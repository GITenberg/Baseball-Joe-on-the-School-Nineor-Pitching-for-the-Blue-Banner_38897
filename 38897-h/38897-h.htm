<h1>BASEBALL JOE ON THE
SCHOOL NINE</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h3>HITTING A TEACHER</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Look out now, fellows; here goes for a high
one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw come off; you can&rsquo;t throw high without
dislocating your arm, Peaches. Don&rsquo;t try it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get off the earth; I can so, Teeter.
Watch me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Joe Matson have a try. He can throw
higher than you can, Peaches,&rdquo; and the lad who
had last spoken grasped the arm of a tall boy,
with a very fair complexion which had gained
him the nickname of &ldquo;Peaches and Cream,&rdquo;
though it was usually shortened to &ldquo;Peaches.&rdquo;
There was a crowd of lads on the school grounds,
throwing snowballs, when the offer of &ldquo;Peaches&rdquo;
or Dick Lantfeld was made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him throw, Teeter,&rdquo; begged George
Bland, jokingly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not,&rdquo; retorted &ldquo;Teeter&rdquo; Nelson, whose
first name was Harry, but who had gained his
appellation because of a habit he had of &ldquo;teetering&rdquo;
on his tiptoes when reciting in class. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got Peaches all right,&rdquo; and there was a struggle
between the two lads, one trying to throw a snowball,
and the other trying to prevent him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Joe,&rdquo; called Teeter, to a tall, good-looking,
and rather quiet youth who stood beside
a companion. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see you throw. You&rsquo;re always
good at it, and I&rsquo;ll keep Peaches out of the
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we try, Tom?&rdquo; asked Joe Matson of
his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might as well. Come on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, let &lsquo;Sister&rsquo; Davis have a whack at it
too,&rdquo; urged George Bland. Tom Davis, who was
Joe Matson&rsquo;s particular chum, was designated
&ldquo;Sister&rdquo; because, in an incautious moment, when
first coming to Excelsior Hall, he had shown a
picture of his very pretty sister, Mabel.</p>

<p>Tom and Joe, who had come upon the group
of other pupils after the impromptu snowball
throwing contest had started, advanced further toward
their school companions. Peaches and
Teeter were still engaged in their friendly struggle,
until Peaches tripped over a stone, concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
under a blanket of snow, and both went down in
a struggling heap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it a touchdown!&rdquo; yelled George Bland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, shove him over the line, Peaches!&rdquo;
cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold him! Hold him!&rdquo; implored Joe, and
the little group of lads, which was increased by the
addition of several other pupils, circled about the
struggling ones, laughing at their plight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D-d-down!&rdquo; finally panted Peaches, when
Teeter held his face in the soft snow. &ldquo;Let me
up, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise not to try to throw a high one?&rdquo;
asked Teeter, still maintaining his position astride
of Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;I guess so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t go with me; you&rsquo;ve got to be
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, let a fellow up, will you? There&rsquo;s
a lot of snow down my neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happened to me the last time you
fired a high snowball, Peaches. That&rsquo;s why I
didn&rsquo;t want you to try another while I&rsquo;m around.
You wait until I&rsquo;m off the campus if you&rsquo;ve got to
indulge in high jinks. Come on now, fellows,
since Peaches has promised to behave himself, let
the merry dance go on. Have you tried a shot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Joe? Or you, Sister,&rdquo; and Teeter looked at the
newcomers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered Joe Matson with a smile.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t had a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; put in Tom Davis. &ldquo;You
started a rough-house with Peaches as soon as we
got here. What&rsquo;s on, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re just seeing how straight we can
aim with snowballs,&rdquo; explained Teeter. &ldquo;See if
you can hit that barrel head down there,&rdquo; and he
pointed to the object in question, about forty yards
away on the school campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See if you can hit the barrel, Joe,&rdquo; urged
George Bland. &ldquo;A lot of us have missed it, including
Peaches, who seems to think his particular
stunt is high throwing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so it is!&rdquo; interrupted the lad with the
clear complexion. &ldquo;I can beat any one here
at&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save that talk until the baseball season
opens!&rdquo; retorted Teeter. &ldquo;Go ahead, Joe and
Tom. And you other fellows can try if you like,&rdquo;
he added, for several more pupils had joined the
group.</p>

<p>It might seem easy to hit the head of a barrel
at that distance, but either the lads were not expert
enough or else the snowballs, being of irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
shapes and rather light, did not carry well.
Whatever the cause, the fact remained that the
barrel received only a few scattering shots and
these on the outer edges of the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see what Sister Davis can do!&rdquo;
exclaimed Nat Pierson, as Joe&rsquo;s chum stepped up
to the firing line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not so much,&rdquo; answered Tom with a
half smile. &ldquo;Joe will beat me all to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Matson sure can throw,&rdquo; commented
Teeter, in a low voice to George Bland. &ldquo;I remember
what straight aim he had the last time we
built a fort, and had a snow fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say yes,&rdquo; agreed George. &ldquo;And talk
about speed!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Wow! One ball he
threw soaked me in the ear. I can feel it yet!&rdquo;
and he rubbed the side of his head reflectively.</p>

<p>The first ball that Tom threw just clipped the
upper rim of the barrel head, and there were some
exclamations of admiration. The second one was
a clean miss, but not by a large margin. The third
missile split into fragments on the rim of the
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Peaches. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to
do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you see Joe plug it,&rdquo; retorted Tom
with a smile.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not such a wonder,&rdquo; remarked our
hero modestly, as he advanced to the line. In his
hand he held three very hard and smooth snowballs,
which he spent some time in making in anticipation
of his turn to throw. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had
much practice lately,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;though I used
to throw pretty straight when the baseball season
was on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe carefully measured with his eye the distance
to the barrel. Then he swung his arm
around a few times to &ldquo;limber up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fellow used to pitch on some nine, I&rsquo;ll
wager,&rdquo; said Teeter in a whisper to Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard something about him being a
star on some small country team,&rdquo; was the retort.
&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s watch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe threw. The ball left his hand with tremendous
speed and, an instant later, had struck
the head of the barrel with a resounding &ldquo;ping!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the centre! In the centre!&rdquo; yelled Peaches
with enthusiasm as he capered about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mighty good shot!&rdquo; complimented Teeter,
doing his particular toe stunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly in the centre,&rdquo; admitted Joe.
&ldquo;Here goes for another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more he threw, and again the snowball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hit the barrel head, close to the first, but not quite
so near the middle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do better than that, Joe,&rdquo; spoke Tom
in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try,&rdquo; was all the thrower said.</p>

<p>Again his arm was swung around with the peculiar
motion used by many good baseball pitchers.
Again the snowball shot forward, whizzing
through the air. Again came that resounding
thud on the hollow barrel, this time louder than
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right on the nose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A clean middle shot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good plunk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These cries greeted Joe&rsquo;s last effort, and, sure
enough, when several lads ran to get a closer view
of the barrel, they came back to report that the
ball was exactly in the centre of the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re a wonder!&rdquo; exclaimed Peaches,
admiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a wonder?&rdquo; inquired a new voice, and
a tall heavily-built lad, with rather a coarse and
brutal face, sauntered up to the group. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
been doing wonderful stunts, Peaches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Matson here. He hit the barrel head
three times out of three, and the best any of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
could do was once. Besides, Joe poked it in the
exact centre once, and nearly twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; spoke the newcomer, with a
sneer in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see you do it, Shell,&rdquo; invited George
Bland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, Hiram, show &rsquo;em what you can do,&rdquo;
urged Luke Fodick, who was a sort of toady to
Hiram Shell, the school bully, if ever there was
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just watch me,&rdquo; requested Hiram, and hastily
taking some hard round snowballs away from a
smaller lad who had made them for his own use,
the bully threw.</p>

<p>I must do him the credit to say that he was a
good shot, and all three of his missiles hit the
barrel head. But two of them clipped the outer
edge, and only one was completely on, and that
nowhere near the centre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Matson&rsquo;s got you beat a mile!&rdquo; exclaimed
Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered Hiram with the
easy superior air he generally assumed. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d
been practicing all day as you fellows have I could
poke the centre every time, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, those three balls were the
first Joe had thrown that day, but he did not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it wise to say so, for Hiram had mean ways about
him, and none of the pupils at Excelsior Hall
cared to rouse his anger unnecessarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;ve all had our turns,&rdquo; spoke
George Bland, after Hiram had thrown a few
more balls so carelessly as to miss the barrel entirely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; piped up Tommy Burton, one of
the youngest lads. &ldquo;Hiram took my snowballs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, what of it, kid?&rdquo; sneered the bully.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots more snow. Make yourself another
set and see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tommy was bashful, and the attention he
had thus drawn upon himself made him blush.
He was a timid lad and he shrank away now,
evidently fearing Shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; spoke Peaches kindly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
have another contest soon and you can be in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who can throw the farthest,&rdquo; suggested
Hiram. His great strength gave him a
decided advantage in this, as he very well knew.</p>

<p>The other boys also knew this, but did not like
to refuse to enter the lists with him, so the long-distance
throwing was started. Hiram did throw
hard and far, but he met his match in Joe Matson,
and the bully evidently did not like it. He sneered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
at Joe&rsquo;s style and did his best to beat him, but
could not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ate too much dinner to-day,&rdquo; said Hiram
finally, as an excuse, &ldquo;so I can&rsquo;t throw well,&rdquo; and
though there were covert smiles at this palpable
excuse, no one said anything. Then came other
contests, throwing at trees and different objects.
Finally Hiram and Luke took themselves off, and
everyone else was glad of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a bluff, Shell is!&rdquo; murmured
Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mean,&rdquo; added George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe, I wonder if you can throw over those
trees,&rdquo; spoke Tom, pointing to a fringe of big
maples which bordered a walk that ran around
the school campus. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something of a
throw for height and distance. Want to try?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented our hero, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t
know as I can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; put in Peaches. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
throw together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They quickly made a couple of hard, smooth
balls, and at the word from Tom, Joe and
Peaches let go together, for it was to be a sort of
contest in swiftness.</p>

<p>The white missiles sailed through the air side
by side, and not far apart. Higher and higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
they went, until they both topped the trees, and
began to go down on the other side. Joe&rsquo;s was
far in advance of the snowball of Peaches, however,
and went higher.</p>

<p>As the balls descended and went out of sight,
there suddenly arose from the other side of the
trees a series of expostulating yells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop it! Stop that, I say! How dare you
throw snowballs at me? I shall report you at
once! Who are you? Don&rsquo;t you dare to run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we hit some one,&rdquo; faltered Peaches, his
fair complexion blushing a bright red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess we did,&rdquo; admitted Joe.</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it a moment later, for
through the trees came running a figure whose
tall hat was battered over his head by the snowballs,
some fragments of the missiles still clinging
to the tile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sure did,&rdquo; added Teeter, stifling a laugh.
&ldquo;And of all persons in the school but Professor
Rodd. Oh my! Oh wow! You&rsquo;re in for it now!
He won&rsquo;t do a thing to you fellows! Look at his
hat! Here he comes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Elias Rodd, one of the strictest and
certainly the &ldquo;fussiest&rdquo; instructor at Excelsior,
was hurrying toward the group of boys.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>PLANNING A BATTLE</h3>


<p>Professor Elias Rodd was rather elderly,
and, as he never took much exercise, his sprinting
abilities were not pronounced. So it took him
about a minute and a half to cross the campus to
where the little group of lads awaited him&mdash;anxious
waiting it was too, on the part of Joe and
Peaches. And in that minute and a half, before
the excitement begins, I want to take the opportunity
to tell you something about Joe Matson,
and his chum Tom Davis, and how they happened
to be at Excelsior Hall.</p>

<p>Those of you who have read the first volume
of this series entitled, &ldquo;Baseball Joe of the Silver
Stars,&rdquo; need no introduction to our hero. Sufficient
to say that he was a lad who thought more
of baseball than of any other sport.</p>

<p>Joe was the son of Mr. and Mrs. John Matson,
and he had a sister named Clara. Joe&rsquo;s father
was an inventor of farming machinery and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
apparatus, and had been employed by the Royal
Harvester Works of Riverside, which was located
on the Appleby River, in one of our New England
States. Joe lived in Riverside, his family
having moved there from Bentville.</p>

<p>In the previous story I told how Joe made the
acquaintance of Tom Davis, who lived in the
house back of him. Joe became interested in the
Silver Stars, the Riverside amateur nine, and
through doing a favor for Darrell Blackney, the
manager, was given a position in the field.</p>

<p>But Joe wanted to become a pitcher, and, in
fact, had pitched for the Bentville Boosters. He
longed to fill the box for the Stars, and was finally
given a chance. But he had incurred the enmity
of Sam Morton, the regular pitcher, and there
were several clashes between them. Finally Joe
displaced Sam and won many games for the Stars.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson had some trouble with his inventions,
for Isaac Benjamin, manager of the harvester
works, and Rufus Holdney, the latter once
a friend of the inventor, determined to get certain
valuable patents away from Mr. Matson. How
they nearly succeeded, and how Joe foiled the
plans of the plotters once, is told in the first
book.</p>

<p>Though Joe aided his father considerably, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
young pitcher never lost his interest in baseball,
and when, at the last moment, word came that
Mr. Matson had seemingly lost everything, Joe
hid his own feelings and went off to pitch the
deciding championship game against the Resolutes
of Rocky Ford, the bitter rivals of the Silver
Stars.</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s heart was heavy as he pitched, for he
knew that if his father lost his money through the
taking away of his patents there would be no
chance of his going to boarding school, and Joe
desired that above everything.</p>

<p>But he pluckily pitched the game, which was a
close and hot one. He won, making the Stars the
champions of the county league; and then Joe
hurried home.</p>

<p>To his delight there was a message from his
father, stating that at the last minute unexpected
evidence had won the patent case for him, and he
was now on the road to prosperity.</p>

<p>So it was possible for Joe to go to boarding
school after all, and, to his delight, Tom Davis
prevailed upon his parents to send him. So Joe
and Tom went off together to attend Excelsior
Hall, just outside of Cedarhurst, and about a hundred
miles from Riverside.</p>

<p>Joe and Tom, who had each finished short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
courses in the Riverside High School, started for
Excelsior Hall at the opening of the Fall term, and
had spent the Winter, with the exception of the
Christmas holidays, at the institution. They liked
it very much, and made a number of friends as
well as some enemies. Their chief foe, as well
as that of nearly every other lad in Excelsior
Hall, was Hiram Shell.</p>

<p>The months passed, and with the waning of
Winter, Joe began to feel the call of the baseball
diamond. He and Tom got out some old gloves
and balls and bats, and in the seclusion of their
room they played over again, in imagination, some
of the stirring games of the Silver Stars. As yet,
however, there had been no baseball activity at
Excelsior, and Joe was wondering what sort of
team there would be, for that there must be one
was a foregone conclusion. Joe knew that before
he picked out Excelsior Hall as his particular
boarding school.</p>

<p>I might add that Dr. Wright Fillmore was the
principal of Excelsior Hall. He was dubbed
&ldquo;Cæsar&rdquo; because of his fondness for the character
of that warrior, and because he was always
holding him up as a pattern of some virtues to
his pupils. Dr. Enos Rudden the mathematical
teacher was one of the best-liked of all the instructors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
He was fond of athletics, and acted as
sort of head coach and trainer for the football
and baseball teams.</p>

<p>As much as Dr. Rudden was liked so was Professor
Rodd disliked. Professor Rodd, who was
privately termed &ldquo;Sixteen and a Half&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sixteen&rdquo;
for short (because of the number of feet in
a rod) was very exacting, fussy and a terror to the
lads who failed to know their Latin lessons.</p>

<p>And as we are at present immediately concerned
with Professor Rodd, now I will go back
to where we left him approaching the group of
students, with wrath plainly written on his countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who threw that ball&mdash;that snowball?&rdquo;
the irate instructor cried. &ldquo;I demand to know.
Look at my hat! Look at it, I say!&rdquo; and that
there might be no difficulty in the boys seeing it
Mr. Rodd endeavored to take off his head-piece.</p>

<p>But he found this no easy matter, for the snowballs,
hitting it with considerable force, had driven
it down over his brow. He struggled to get it
off and this only made him the more angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who threw those balls at me?&rdquo; again
demanded Professor Rodd, and this time he managed
to work off his hat. He held it out accusingly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;we all were having a
throwing contest,&rdquo; explained Teeter Nelson, diffidently,
&ldquo;and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly <i>all</i> didn&rsquo;t throw at me,&rdquo; interrupted
the professor. &ldquo;Only two balls struck me,
and I demand to know who threw them. Or shall
I report you all to Dr. Fillmore and have him
keep you in bounds for a week; eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody meant to hit you, Professor,&rdquo; put in
Tom. &ldquo;You see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you or will you not answer my question?&rdquo;
snapped the instructor, in the same tone of
voice he used in the classroom, when some luckless
lad was stuttering and stammering over the
difference between the <i>gerund</i> and the <i>gerundive</i>.
&ldquo;Who threw the balls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I did,&rdquo; faltered Joe. &ldquo;I threw
one, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I threw the other,&rdquo; popped out Peaches.
&ldquo;But it was an accident, Professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An accident! Humph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; eagerly went on Peaches, who, having
been longer at the school than Joe, knew better
how to handle the irate instructor. &ldquo;You see it
was this way: We were having a contest, and
wanted to see who could throw over the trees.
Instead of throwing <i>primus</i>, <i>secondus</i>, and <i>tertius</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as we might have done, Joe and I threw together&mdash;um&mdash;er&mdash;ah
<i>conjunctim</i> so to speak,&rdquo; and
Peaches managed to keep a straight face even
while struggling to find the right Latin word.
&ldquo;Yes, we threw <i>conjunctim</i>&mdash;together&mdash;and we
both wanted to see who could do the best&mdash;er&mdash;<i>supero</i>&mdash;you
know, and&mdash;er we&mdash;well, it was an
accident&mdash;<i>casus eventus</i>. We are awfully sorry,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Rodd gave an audible sniff, but there
was a marked softening of the hard lines about
his face. He was an enthusiastic Latin scholar,
and the trial of his life was to know that most of
his pupils hated the study&mdash;indeed as many boys
do. So when the teacher found one who took the
trouble in ordinary conversation to use a few
Latin words, or phrases, the professor was correspondingly
pleased. Peaches knew this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a <i>casus eventus</i>&mdash;an accident,&rdquo; the fair-cheeked
lad repeated, very proud of his ability in
the dead language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are very sorry,&rdquo; put in Joe, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll pay
for having your hat ironed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We threw in <i>conjunctim</i>,&rdquo; murmured Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! A very good attempt at the Latin&mdash;at
least some of the words are,&rdquo; admitted Professor
Rodd. &ldquo;They do credit to your studying, Lantfeld,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
but how in the world did you ever get <i>casus
eventus</i> into accident?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;it&rsquo;s so in the dictionary, Professor,&rdquo;
pleaded Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but look up the substantive, and remember
your endings. Here I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; and, pulling
from his pocket a Latin dictionary, which he
was never without, Professor Rodd, sticking his
battered hat back on his head, began to quote and
translate and do all manner of things with the
dead language, to show Peaches where he had
made his errors. And Peaches, sacrificing himself
on the altar of friendship, stood there like a
man, nodding his head and agreeing with everything
the instructor said, whether he understood
it or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your <i>conjunctim</i> was not so bad,&rdquo; complimented
the professor, &ldquo;but I could never pass
<i>casus eventus</i>. However, I am glad to see that
you take an interest in your studies. I wish more
of the boys did. Now take the irregular conjugation
for instance. We will begin with the
indicative mood and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor&rsquo;s voice was droning off into his
classroom tones. Peaches held his ground valiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows, cut for it!&rdquo; whispered Teeter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hoarsely. &ldquo;Leg it, Joe. Peaches will take
care of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the hat&mdash;I damaged it&mdash;I want to pay
for it,&rdquo; objected our hero, who was square in
everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that. When Old Sixteen
gets to spouting Latin or Greek he doesn&rsquo;t know
whether he&rsquo;s on his head or his feet, and as for a
hat&mdash;say, forget it and come on. He&rsquo;ll never
mention it again. Peaches knows how to handle
him. Peaches is the best Latin lad in the whole
school, and once Sixteen finds some one who will
listen to his new theory about conjugating irregular
verbs, he&rsquo;ll talk until midnight. Come on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Peaches!&rdquo; murmured Tom Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Sister,&rdquo; spoke George Bland, as
he linked his arm in that of Joe. &ldquo;Peaches seen
his duty and he done it nobly, as the novels say.
When Sixteen gets through with him we&rsquo;ll blow
him to a feed to make it up to him. Come on
while the going&rsquo;s good. He&rsquo;ll never see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the day&mdash;rather an eventful one as it was
destined to become&mdash;came to an end. The boys
filed into the big dining hall, and talk, which had
begun to verge around to baseball, could scarcely
be heard for the clatter of knives and forks and
dishes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time later there came a cautious knock
on the door of the room that Tom Davis and Joe
Matson shared. The two lads were deep in their
books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Joe sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;Peaches,&rdquo; was the quick if ungrammatical
answer. &ldquo;The coast is clear&mdash;open your
oak,&rdquo; and he rattled the knob of the door.</p>

<p>Tom unlocked and swung wide the portal, and
the hero of the Latin engagement entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick&mdash;anything to drink?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a rag! Say, I never swallowed so much dry
Latin in my life. My throat is parched. Don&rsquo;t
tell me that all that ginger ale you smuggled in
the other day is gone&mdash;don&rsquo;t you dare do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, see if there&rsquo;s a bottle left for the gentleman
of thirst,&rdquo; directed Joe with a smile.</p>

<p>Tom went to the window and pulled up a cord
that was fastened to the sill. On the end of the
string was a basket, and in it three bottles of ginger
ale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our patent refrigerator,&rdquo; explained Joe, with
a wave of his hand. &ldquo;Do the uncorking act,
Tom, and we&rsquo;ll get busy. You can go to sleep,&rdquo;&mdash;this
last to a book he had been studying, as he
tossed it on a couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; murmured Peaches as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
he drained his glass. &ldquo;Now I can talk. I came
in, Joe and Tom, to see if you didn&rsquo;t think it
would be a good thing to have a fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fight! For cats&rsquo; sake, who with?&rdquo; demanded
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you spoiling for one?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean a snowball fight. This is probably
the last of the season, and I was thinking we
could get a lot of fellows together, make a fort,
and have a regular battle like we read about in
Cæsar to-day. It would be no end of sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so myself,&rdquo; agreed Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom sententiously, burying
his nose in his ginger ale glass. &ldquo;Go on, tell us
some more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was thinking,&rdquo; resumed Peaches,
&ldquo;that we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by another tap on the door.
In an instant Peaches had dived under the table.
With one sweep of his arm Joe noiselessly collected
the bottles, while Joe spread a paper over
the glasses. The knock was repeated, and the
two lads looked apprehensively at the door.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>AN ANGRY BULLY</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t one of you fellows open
the door?&rdquo; demanded Peaches in a hoarse whisper
from his point of vantage under the table. &ldquo;If
it&rsquo;s one of the &lsquo;profs.&rsquo; or a monitor, he&rsquo;ll get wise
if you wait all this while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It might be explained that there was a rule at
Excelsior Hall against students visiting in their
classmates&rsquo; rooms at certain hours of the day, unless
permission had been secured from the professor
or monitor in charge of the dormitory.
Needless to say Peaches had not secured any such
permission&mdash;the lads seldom did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to open it?&rdquo; again demanded
Peaches, from where he had taken refuge,
so as to be out of sight, should the caller prove to
be some one in authority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;certainly&mdash;of course,&rdquo; replied Joe.
&ldquo;Tom, you open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more came the knock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open it yourself,&rdquo; insisted Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as
much your room as it is mine. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was no need for any one to first encounter
the stern gaze of some professor, if such
the unannounced caller should prove to be. The
knock was repeated and then a voice demanded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows needn&rsquo;t pretend not to be in
there. I can hear you whispering. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
and with that the portal swung open and Teeter
Nelson entered. He advanced to the middle of
the room and stood moving up and down on his
tiptoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like your nerve!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Having a
spread and not tipping a fellow off. Is it all
gone?&rdquo; and with a sweep of his arm he sent the
paper cover flying from over the half-emptied ginger
ale glasses. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Peaches?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s out, for I was at his den,
and there&rsquo;s not a soul in. He&rsquo;s got a &lsquo;dummy&rsquo;
in the bed, but it&rsquo;s rank. Wouldn&rsquo;t fool anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must have spoiled it!&rdquo; exclaimed
Peaches, sticking his head out from beneath the
table, the cloth draping itself around his neck like
a lady&rsquo;s scarf. &ldquo;I made a dandy figure. It would
fool even Sixteen himself; and then I sneaked out.
I made it look as natural as could be. I&rsquo;ll bet
you did something to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only punched it a couple of times to see if it
was you,&rdquo; retorted Teeter. &ldquo;But say, what&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
going on? Why didn&rsquo;t you open when I
knocked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought it was a prof.,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you give the code knock. Tat&mdash;rat-a-tat-tat&mdash;tat-tat&mdash;and
the hiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I did forget it. But I got all
excited when I found that Peaches had sneaked
off without telling me. Say, what&rsquo;s on, anyhow?
Where&rsquo;s the feed? Give me something good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing going but ginger ale,&rdquo; answered Joe,
as Peaches crawled the rest of the way out from
under the table. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know as there&rsquo;s
any left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, you fellows have nerve!&rdquo; complained
the newcomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one bottle,&rdquo; said Tom, who had
charge of the improvised refrigerator, and forthwith
he hauled up the basket, at the sight of which
Teeter laughed joyously, and proceeded to get
outside of his share of the refreshments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; he demanded, after his thirst
was quenched, and when they were all seated at
the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a snow battle,&rdquo; explained
Peaches. &ldquo;We were just talking about it when
you gave us heart disease by pounding on the
oak.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Heart disease; my eye!&rdquo; exclaimed Teeter.
&ldquo;You should have a clear conscience such as I
have, and nothing would worry you. That&rsquo;s good
ale all right, Joe. Got any more?&rdquo; and he finished
his glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nary a drop. But go on, Peaches. Tell us
more about the snow fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon the lad did, waxing enthusiastic,
and causing his chums to get into the same state
of mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be no end of fun!&rdquo; declared Teeter.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll choose sides and see which one can capture
the fort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When can we do it?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sooner the quicker,&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s opinion.
&ldquo;The snow won&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we ought to start on the fort to-morrow
and have the battle the next day,&rdquo; was the opinion
of Peaches.</p>

<p>Permission to have the snow battle was obtained
from Dr. Fillmore the next day, and the
work of building the snow fort started soon after
lessons were over. Fortunately the white flakes
packed well, and with a foundation of a number
of big snowballs the fort was shortly in process of
construction.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>A better day for a snow battle could not have
been desired. It was just warm enough so that
the snow stuck, and yet cool enough so that the exertion
would not be unpleasant. The fort was at
the far end of the big school campus, and all
about it the ground had been practically cleared of
snow to build it. This made it necessary for the
attacking party to carry their ammunition from
afar. As for the defenders of the fort, they
had plenty of snow inside, and, as a last resort
they could use part of the walls of the structure itself
to repel the enemy.</p>

<p>The lads had made wooden shields for themselves,
some using the heads of barrels, with leather
loops for hand and arm. Others were content
with something simpler, a mere board, or a barrel
stave.</p>

<p>Sides had been chosen, and, somewhat to his
own surprise, Joe Matson was made captain of the
attacking force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want you because you can throw straight
and hard,&rdquo; explained Teeter, who was a sort of
lieutenant of the attacking army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soak those fellows good!&rdquo; pleaded Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to look out for icy balls,&rdquo; cautioned
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Joe, as he looked toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fort where Frank Brown, as captain, was marshalling
his lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard that Hiram Shell and Luke Fodick
soaked a lot of snowballs in water last night, and
let &rsquo;em freeze,&rdquo; went on Tom. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just
mean enough to use them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Peaches, &ldquo;and we made
it up not to throw that kind. Well, if we catch
Hiram or Luke using &rsquo;em we&rsquo;ll make a protest,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, are you fellows all ready?&rdquo; asked Frank
Brown at length, as he looked to see if he and his
mates had a good supply of ammunition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;Yell when you want
us to come at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any time now,&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;Get on the
job, fellows!&rdquo; he called to his force.</p>

<p>The snow battle began. Joe and his lads had
boxes and baskets of snowballs piled where they
could easily get them. They took them with them,
up to the very walls of the fort, certain boys being
designated as ammunition carriers.</p>

<p>The fight was fast and furious. The air was
thick with flying balls; and the yells, shouts, cries,
and laughter of the lads could be heard afar.</p>

<p>Up to the fort swarmed Joe and his mates, only
to be driven back by a withering fire. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
came once more to the attack, pouring in a destructive
rain of white balls on the defenders of
the snow fort. But this resulted partly in disaster
for the attacking foe, as several of their number
were captured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At &rsquo;em again!&rdquo; ordered Joe, after a slight repulse.
&ldquo;We can capture that place!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more they swarmed to the attack, and with
very good effect, delivering such a rattling volley
of balls, that the defenders were thrown into confusion,
and could not send back an answering fire
quickly enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swarm the walls! Swarm the walls!&rdquo; yelled
Joe.</p>

<p>He and his lads scrambled up, their pockets
filled with balls. Down upon the hapless foe they
threw them, and in another moment the fort would
have been theirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Repel boarders! Repel boarders!&rdquo; sang out
Hiram. &ldquo;Come on, fellows, give &rsquo;em an extra
dose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe saw the bully, and Luke, his crony, rush to a
corner of the fort and take something from a
wooden box. The next instant several lads uttered
cries of real pain, as they felt the missiles
of almost solid ice hit them. Joe understood at
once.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The mean, sneaking coward!&rdquo; he cried. In
his hand he held a large snowball. It was hard
packed, but did not equal the ice balls in any
particular. Yet it was effective.</p>

<p>Joe saw the chance he wanted. Hiram had
drawn back his hand to throw one of the missiles
he and Luke had secretly made, when, with a suddenness
that was startling, Joe threw his large
snowball full in the bully&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Hiram caught his breath. The ball he had intended
throwing fell from his hand. He staggered
back, his face a mass of snow. Then he
recovered himself, cleared his eyes of the flakes
and, with a yell of rage sprang forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you throw that, Joe Matson!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;You had no right to pitch it with all your might
at such close range.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had as much right as you and Luke have to
use iceballs,&rdquo; retorted our hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fix you for that!&rdquo; threatened Hiram,
boiling over with wrath, as he scrambled up the
inner walls of the fort and stood before Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
knock you into the middle of next week! I&rsquo;ll teach
you how to behave. I&rsquo;m going to lick you good,&rdquo;
and he drew back his fist, and aimed a mighty
blow at our hero.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>JOE LEARNS SOMETHING</h3>


<p>Joe Matson had been in fights before. Some
had been forced upon him, and he accepted the
challenges for sufficient reasons, and had given
a good account of himself in the battles. Other
fistic encounters had been of his own seeking and
for excellent reasons he had generally come out
ahead.</p>

<p>The prospective fight with the bully was very
sudden. Joe had seen what he considered a mean
trick on Hiram&rsquo;s part and had thrown on the
impulse of the moment. He rather regretted his
hasty action, but it was too late for regrets now,
and he was willing to accept the outcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make you wish you&rsquo;d never
come to Excelsior Hall!&rdquo; cried Hiram, and with
that he expected the blow which he had aimed at
Joe to land on the countenance of our hero.</p>

<p>But, like the celebrated flea of history, who,
as the Dutchman said, &ldquo;ven you put your finger
on him, dot flea he aind&rsquo;t dere!&rdquo; so it was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Joe. He cleverly ducked, and then waited for
what would happen next.</p>

<p>Something did happen with a vengeance.
Hiram had rushed up the slippery, sloping, inner
wall of the fort to get at Joe, and pummel him
for sending the snowball smashing into his face,
but when Joe turned aside, and Hiram&rsquo;s fist went
through the air like a batter fanning over a swift
ball, the bully was unable to recover himself.</p>

<p>He overbalanced, clawed vainly at the atmosphere,
made a grab for Joe, who took good care
to keep well out of reach, and then <a href="#image02">Hiram Shell
went slipping and sliding down the outside wall
of the snow fort</a>, turning over several times ere
he landed at the bottom, amid a pile of the white
flakes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<a name="image02" id="image02"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="375" height="600" alt="HIRAM SHELL WENT SLIPPING AND SLIDING DOWN THE OUTSIDE WALL OF THE SNOW FORT." title="HIRAM SHELL WENT SLIPPING AND SLIDING DOWN THE OUTSIDE WALL OF THE SNOW FORT." /></a>
<br /><span class="caption"><a href="#Page_32">HIRAM SHELL WENT SLIPPING AND SLIDING DOWN THE
OUTSIDE WALL OF THE SNOW FORT.</a></span>
</div>

<p>In his descent he struck several lads who were
swarming up to the attack, and these Hiram
bowled over like tenpins, so that when he came
to rest he was in the centre of a pile of heaving
bodies, and of threshing and swaying arms and
legs, like a football player downed after a long
run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get off me, you fellows!&rdquo; yelled Hiram, when
he could get his breath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll punch some of you
good and hard for this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll get punched yourself if you don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
take your feet out of my face!&rdquo; retorted Peaches,
who was one of the few pupils not afraid of the
bully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that Joe Matson? I&rsquo;ve got a score
to settle with him,&rdquo; went on Hiram, as he
struggled to his feet, and disentangled himself
from the mass of snow-warriors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have one to settle with me if you
knock me down again!&rdquo; cried Teeter Nelson, as
he tried to shake some snow out from inside his
collar. It was melting and running down his
back in little cold streams. &ldquo;What do you mean
by playing that way?&rdquo; demanded Teeter, who
had not seen the impending fight between Joe and
Hiram. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay inside your own
fort, and not make a human battering ram of
yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mind your own business!&rdquo; snapped
Hiram with an ugly look. &ldquo;I slipped and fell, or
else Joe Matson pushed me. Wait until I get
hold of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a look of anger on his face, Hiram
turned and went swarming up the outer wall of
the fort. At the top stood Joe, waiting, and the
lad&rsquo;s face showed no signs of fear, though he was
a trifle pale. Though Hiram was larger, and
evidently stronger than Joe, our hero was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
afraid. He was debating in his mind whether it
would not be better to rush to the ground below,
where he would have a better chance if it came
to an out-and-out-fight. Yet Joe had a certain
advantage on top of the snow wall, for he could
easily push Hiram down. Yet this was not his
idea of a contest of that kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you, Matson!&rdquo; muttered the bully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you to push me down! You might
have broken my arm or leg,&rdquo; he added in an injured
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t push you!&rdquo; retorted our hero. &ldquo;You
tried to hit me and missed. Then you fell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; chimed in Peaches, amid a
silence, for the general snowball fight had ceased
in anticipation of another kind of an encounter.</p>

<p>Hiram balanced himself half way up the white
wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you smash me in the face with a
snowball for?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;We made it up
that no one was to aim at another fellow&rsquo;s face
at close range, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I know it,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;But
that rule applied to hard balls, and I didn&rsquo;t use
one. I threw a soft ball at you, and you know
why I did it, too. I&rsquo;ll let Luke Fodick have one,
too, if he does it again.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Does what again?&rdquo; sneered the bully&rsquo;s
crony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use icy balls. I saw you and Hiram take
some frozen ones from that box,&rdquo; and Joe
pointed to the secret supply of ammunition.
&ldquo;Some of our fellows were hit and that&rsquo;s why I
threw in your face, Hiram. Now, if you want to
fight I&rsquo;m ready for you,&rdquo; and Joe stood well
balanced on top of the wall, awaiting the approach
of his enemy.</p>

<p>Somehow the fighting spirit was oozing out of
Hiram. He felt sure that he could whip Joe
in a battle on level ground, but when his opponent
stood above him, and when it was evident
that Joe could deliver a blow before Hiram could,
with the probability that it would send the attacker
sliding down the wall again, the bully
began to see that discretion was the better part
of valor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to fight?&rdquo; demanded Hiram, in
that tone which sometimes means that the questioner
would be glad to get a negative answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not aching for it,&rdquo; replied Joe slowly.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to run away. If you like
I&rsquo;ll come down, but you can come up if you want
to,&rdquo; and he smiled at Hiram. &ldquo;You only got
what you deserved, you know.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; chimed in Teeter. &ldquo;You
hadn&rsquo;t any right to use frozen balls, Hiram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not!&rdquo; came in a menacing chorus from
Joe&rsquo;s crowd of lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they weren&rsquo;t frozen very hard,&rdquo; mumbled
Hiram. &ldquo;I only threw a few, anyhow, and
you&rsquo;ve got more fellows than we have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we captured some of yours&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
admitted Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all right then,&rdquo; answered the bully with
no good grace. &ldquo;But if you throw at my face
again, at such close range, Joe Matson, I&rsquo;ll give
you the best licking you ever had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two can play at that game,&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s retort.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready any time you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go at him now, and clean him
up?&rdquo; asked Luke Fodick, making his way to
where Hiram stood. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t he&rsquo;ll be saying
he backed you to a standstill. Go at him,
Hiram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good notion to,&rdquo; muttered the bully.</p>

<p>He measured with his eye the distance between
himself and Joe, and wondered if he could cover
it in a rush, carry his opponent off his feet, and
batter and pummel him as they rolled down the
fort wall together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; urged Luke.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I will!&rdquo; spoke Hiram desperately.</p>

<p>Then from the outer fringe of the attacking
crowd there arose a cautious warning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheese it! Here comes old Sixteen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Rodd was approaching and the lads
well knew that he was bitterly opposed to fights,
and would at once report any who engaged in
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on! Let&rsquo;s finish the snow fight!&rdquo; cried
Teeter. &ldquo;Get back in your fort, Hiram, and the
rest of you, and we&rsquo;ll soon capture it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the bully in a low voice. Then
looking at Joe he said: &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the end of it;
not by a long shot, Matson. I&rsquo;ll get square with
you yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as you choose,&rdquo; answered Joe, as he
rallied his lads to the attack again.</p>

<p>Then the snow ball fight went on, with Professor
Rodd an interested onlooker. Joe&rsquo;s boys
finally won, capturing the fort; but the real zest
had been taken out of the battle by the unpleasant
incident, and the boys no longer fought with jolly
good-will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is what I like to see,&rdquo; remarked the
Latin professor, as the lads, having finished the
game, strolled away from the fort which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
been sadly battered and disrupted by the attack
on it. &ldquo;Nothing like good, healthy out-door exercise
to fit the mind for the classics. I&rsquo;m sure
you will all do better in Latin and Greek for this
little diversion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got another think coming as far as I&rsquo;m
concerned,&rdquo; whispered Teeter to Joe. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
got a line of my Cæsar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is certainly what I like to see,&rdquo; went on
the instructor. &ldquo;No hard feelings, yet I venture
to say you all fought well, and hard. It is most
delightful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have been quite so delightful if
you&rsquo;d have come along a few minutes later and
seen a real fight,&rdquo; murmured Peaches. &ldquo;Would
you have stood up to Hiram, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure would. I was ready for him, though
I don&rsquo;t want to be unfriendly to any of the fellows
here. But I couldn&rsquo;t stand for what he did. Oh,
I&rsquo;d have fought him all right, even at the risk
of a whipping, or of beating him, and having him
down on me all the while I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s down on you all right as it is,&rdquo;
ventured George Bland. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s too bad, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know as I care particularly,&rdquo;
spoke Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard you say you wanted to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ball when the Spring season opened,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I do, but what has Hiram Shell got to do
with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots, as you&rsquo;ll very soon learn,&rdquo; put in Teeter.
&ldquo;Hiram is the head of the ball club&mdash;the manager&mdash;I
guess you forgot that, and he runs things. If
he doesn&rsquo;t want a fellow to play&mdash;why, that fellow
doesn&rsquo;t play&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. That&rsquo;s what George
means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented George. &ldquo;And Hiram is sure
down on you after what you did to him to-day,
Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young pitcher stood still. Many thoughts
came to him. He felt a strange sinking sensation,
as if he had suddenly lost hope. He dwelt
for a moment on his great ambition, to be the
star pitcher on the school nine, as he had been
on the nine at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s too late to worry about it
now,&rdquo; remarked Joe after a bit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;no;
I&rsquo;m not either!&rdquo; he cried, with sudden energy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do the same thing over again if I had to,
and if Hiram Shell wants to keep me off the nine
he can do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; cried Teeter, clapping
Joe on the back.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>THE TABLES TURNED</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, Joe, what do you think about it?&rdquo;
Tom Davis glanced at his chum across the room
as he asked this question. It was several hours
after the snow battle, and the two lads were
studying, or making a pretense at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think about what, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean&mdash;what happened
to-day, and how it&rsquo;s going to affect your chances
for the nine. They look rather slim, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that they
do. I didn&rsquo;t know Hiram was such a high-mucky-muck
in baseball here. But there&rsquo;s no use
crying over spilled milk. He and I would have
had a clash sooner or later, anyhow, and it might
as well be first as last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too blamed bad though,&rdquo; went on Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Joe, &ldquo;especially as I picked out
Excelsior Hall because their nine had so many
victories to its credit, and because it had a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
reputation. That&rsquo;s what partly induced you to
come here, too, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, in a way. Of course I like baseball,
but I&rsquo;m not so crazy after it as you are.
Maybe that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not such a good player.
If I can hold down first, or play out in the field,
it suits me; but you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to be pitcher or nothing,&rdquo; interrupted
Joe with a smile, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m a long way
from the box now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, from what I can hear, Hiram has the
inside track in the baseball game. He&rsquo;s manager
chiefly because he puts up a lot of money for the
team, and because his friends, what few he has,
are officers in the organization.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s captain?&rdquo; asked Joe. &ldquo;Maybe I
could induce him to let me play even if Hiram
is down on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing there,&rdquo; replied Tom quickly.
&ldquo;Luke Fodick is captain, or, rather he was last
year, I hear, and he&rsquo;s slated for the same position
this season. Luke and Hiram are as thick as such
fellows always are. When Hiram is hit Luke
does the boo-hoo act for him. No, Luke will be
down on you as much as his crony is. But maybe
we can get up a second nine, and play some
games on our own hook!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that!&rdquo; Joe exclaimed quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not an insurgent. I play with the regulars or not
at all. They&rsquo;d be saying all sorts of things
against me if you and I tried to start an opposition
team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Still it mightn&rsquo;t be a bad idea,
under the circumstances, to have another team,
if it wasn&rsquo;t for what the school would say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Excelsior got dumped in the interscholastic
league last season. They play for the
blue banner you know&mdash;a sort of prize trophy&mdash;and
it was won by Morningside Academy, which
now holds it. That&rsquo;s why I say it might be a
good thing to have some more ginger in the team
here. I know you could put it in, after the way
you pitched on the Silver Stars when they licked
the Resolutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be done I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Joe rejoined.
&ldquo;There can only be one first team in a
school, and I don&rsquo;t want to disrupt things or play
second fiddle. If I can&rsquo;t get on the nine I&rsquo;ll have
to stay off, that&rsquo;s all. But it&rsquo;s going to be mighty
tough to sit still and watch the other fellows play,
and all the while just itching to get hold of the
ball&mdash;mighty tough,&rdquo; and Joe gazed abstractedly
about the room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could help you, old man, but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;I suppose this clash with Hiram had
to come but I do wish it had held off until after
the season opened. Once you were on the nine
you could show the fellows what stuff you had in
your pitching arm, and then Hiram and Luke
could do their worst, but they couldn&rsquo;t get you
off the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice of you to say, but I don&rsquo;t know
about it,&rdquo; remarked Joe. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m about done
studying. I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he did not finish the sentence, for there
came a knock on the door&mdash;a pre-arranged signal
in a certain code of raps, showing that one of their
classmates stood without.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; called Tom, as he went to
open the door.</p>

<p>His quick view through the crack showed the
smiling faces of Teeter and Peaches, and there
was an audible sigh of relief from Joe&rsquo;s roommate.
For Tom had fallen behind in his studies
of late, and had been warned that any infractions
of the rules might mean his suspension for
a week or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, you took long enough to open the door,&rdquo;
complained Teeter, &ldquo;especially considering what
we have with us.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean &lsquo;whom&rsquo; you have with
you?&rdquo; asked Joe, nodding toward Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I mean &lsquo;what,&rsquo;&rdquo; insisted Teeter with a
grin as he unbuttoned his coat and brought into
view several pies, and a couple of packages done
up in paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the game, is it?&rdquo; asked Joe with
a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s more to it,&rdquo; added Peaches, as he
produced two bottles from the legs of his trousers.
&ldquo;This is the best strawberry pop that can be
bought. We&rsquo;ll have a feast as is a feast; eh,
fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lock the door!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, and he did
it himself, being nearest to it. &ldquo;There may be
confiscating spirits abroad in the land to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Sixteen is abroad, anyhow,&rdquo; spoke Teeter
with a laugh, &ldquo;but I guess we&rsquo;ll be safe. I have
a scheme, if worst comes to worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see when the time comes&mdash;if it does.
&lsquo;Now, on with the dance&mdash;let joy be unconfined!&rsquo;
Open the pop, Peaches, and don&rsquo;t sample it until
we&rsquo;re all ready. Got any glasses, you fellows?
This is a return game for the treat you gave us
the other night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll find the glasses all right,&rdquo; spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Joe with a laugh. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s your game, not
to let old Sixteen catch us at this forbidden midnight
feast? Have you dummies in your beds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a dum. But watch my smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the parcels he carried, Teeter produced
what looked to be books&mdash;books, as attested by
the words on their covers&mdash;books dealing with
Latin, and the science of physics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are our plates,&rdquo; he said as he laid the
books down on the table. Then Joe and Tom saw
that the books were merely covers pasted over a
sort of box into which a whole pie could easily be
put. &ldquo;Catch the idea,&rdquo; went on Teeter. &ldquo;We
are eating in here, which is against the rules, worse
luck. But, perchance, some monitor or professor
knocks unexpectedly. Do we have to hustle and
scramble to conceal our refreshments? Answer&mdash;we
do not. What do we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer,&rdquo; broke in Peaches. &ldquo;We merely slip
our pie or sandwiches or whatever it happens to
be, inside our &lsquo;books,&rsquo; and go right on studying.
Catch on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say we did!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about the bottles of strawberry
pop?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t hide them in the
fake books.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve another scheme for that,&rdquo; went on
Teeter. &ldquo;Show &rsquo;em, Peaches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Peaches proceeded to extract the
corks from the bottles of liquid refreshment.
From the packages Teeter had brought he took
some other corks. They had glass tubes through
them, two tubes for each cork. And on one tube
in each cork was a small rubber hose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Teeter as Peaches put
the odd corks in the bottles. &ldquo;We can pour out
the pop with neatness and dispatch into our glasses
and at the same time, should any one unexpectedly
enter, why&mdash;we are only conducting an experiment
in generating oxygen or hydrogen gas. The
bottles are the retorts, and we can pretend our
glasses are to receive the gas. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All to the horse radish!&rdquo; cried Joe in delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then proceed,&rdquo; ordered Teeter with a laugh;
and when all was in readiness each lad sat with a
fake book near him, into which he could slip his
piece of pie at a moment&rsquo;s warning, while on the
table stood the bottles of pop with the tubes and
hose extending from their corks&mdash;truly a most
scientific-looking array of flasks and glassware.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; suggested Teeter, biting generously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
into a pie. &ldquo;That was a great fight we
had to-day, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there might have been one of a different
kind,&rdquo; added Peaches. &ldquo;Hear anything more
from Hiram, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t expect to&mdash;until the next time,
and then I suppose we&rsquo;ll have it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess Joe&rsquo;s goose is cooked as far as getting
on the nine is concerned,&rdquo; ventured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; agreed Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet we&rsquo;re going to need a new pitcher,&rdquo; went
on Teeter. &ldquo;Probably two of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Tom interestedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Rutherford, our star man of last year,
graduated, and he&rsquo;s gone to Princeton or Yale.
Madison, the substitute who was pretty good in
a pinch game, graduated, too; but we thought he
was coming back for an extra course in Latin. I
heard to-day that he isn&rsquo;t, and so that means we&rsquo;ll
have to have two new box-men. There might
be a show for Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; advised Peaches. &ldquo;Not the way
Hiram and Luke feel. They went off by themselves
right after supper to-night, and I heard
them saying something about Joe here, but I
couldn&rsquo;t catch what it was. Oh, they&rsquo;re down on
him all right, for Joe backed Hiram to a standstill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to-day, and that hasn&rsquo;t happened to the bully
in a blue moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I guess I can live if I don&rsquo;t get on
the nine my first season here,&rdquo; spoke Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
keep on trying though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the talk went on, chiefly about baseball,
and gradually the strawberry pop was lowered in
the bottles, and the pie was nearly consumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you had all your trouble for nothing,
Teeter,&rdquo; remarked Tom. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to
be interrupted to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than there was the faint
rattle of the door knob. It was as if some one
had tried it to see if the portal was unlocked before
knocking. Slight as the noise was, the lads
heard it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick! On the job!&rdquo; whispered Teeter. He
crammed the rest of his pie into the fake book, as
did the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Study like blazes!&rdquo; was Teeter&rsquo;s next order.</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen have you any visitors?&rdquo; demanded
the ominous voice of Professor Rodd.</p>

<p>Teeter placed the ends of the rubber tubes one
in each of two glasses before Joe could answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard voices in there&mdash;more than two
voices,&rdquo; went on the Latin instructor grimly, &ldquo;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
I demand that you open the door before I send
for Dr. Fillmore and the janitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom slid to the portal and unlocked it. Professor
Rodd stepped into the room and his stern
gaze took in the two visitors. But he also saw
something else that surprised him.</p>

<p>On the table was apparatus that very much resembled
some used for experiments in the physics
class. And, wonder of wonders, each of the four
lads held a book in his hand&mdash;a book that the
merest glance showed to be either a Latin grammar
or a treatise on chemistry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; faltered the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Aliqui&mdash;aliquare&mdash;aliqua</i>,&rdquo; recited Teeter in a
sing-song declension voice. &ldquo;<i>Aliquorum&mdash;aliquarum&mdash;aliquorum.</i>&rdquo;
Then he pretended to look
up suddenly, as if just aware of the presence
of the instructor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good evening, Professor Rodd,&rdquo; said
Teeter calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; exclaimed the teacher.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it is against the rules for students
to visit in each others&rsquo; rooms after hours
without permission?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it was&mdash;that is for anything but study,&rdquo;
replied Teeter frankly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
minded if we helped each other with our Latin.&rdquo;
Oh! what an innocent look was on his face!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;er&mdash;um&mdash;and you are studying Latin?&rdquo;
asked the professor, while a pleased smile replaced
his frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Professor,&rdquo; put in Peaches. &ldquo;And I
can&rsquo;t seem to remember, nor find, what the neuter
plural accusative of &lsquo;some&rsquo; is. I have gone as far
as <i>aliquos&mdash;aliquas</i>, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Aliqua&mdash;aliqua!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the Professor
quickly. &ldquo;You ought not to forget that. We
had it in class the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, so we did!&rdquo; exclaimed Teeter. &ldquo;I
just remember now; don&rsquo;t you, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Joe, wondering whether or
not they had turned the tables on the teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you so studious,&rdquo; went on Mr.
Rodd. &ldquo;And I see you do not neglect your physics,
either. Ah&mdash;er&mdash;what is the red liquid in the
bottles,&rdquo; and he looked at what remained of the
strawberry pop.</p>

<p>It was the question Tom and Joe had feared
would be asked. But Teeter was equal to the
emergency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; he asked innocently, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t there
some rule regarding <i>quis</i> used in the indefinite in
connection with <i>aliquis</i>?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I am glad you spoke of that,&rdquo; said
Mr. Rodd quickly, rubbing his hands, much
pleased that he had a chance to impart some
Latin information. &ldquo;<i>Quis</i> indefinite is found in
the following compounds: <i>aliquis</i>&mdash;someone; <i>si
quis</i>, if any; <i>ne quis</i>, lest any; <i>ecquis</i>, <i>num quis</i>,
whether any. I am very glad you brought that
up. I will speak of it in class to-morrow. But
I must go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys began to breathe easier and Teeter,
who had been whispering declensions to himself,
left off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; spoke the Professor, as if
he had just thought of it: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind you boys
studying together, if you don&rsquo;t stay up too late.
But it is better to ask permission. However, I will
speak to Dr. Fillmore about it, and it will be all
right from now on. I am pleased that some of
my students are so painstaking. I wish more
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a bow he left them and they tried not
to give way to their exultation until he was far
down the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, talk about pulling off a stunt! We did
it all right!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say yes,&rdquo; agreed the others.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>THE BULLY SNEERS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought to get out a patent on this,&rdquo;
remarked Joe, when they resumed the eating of
the pie and the drinking of the pop, following the
withdrawal of the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sure had,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Let Joe give
you some points. His father has taken out several
patents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess we&rsquo;ll make it free for all&mdash;any
fellow is welcome to the idea,&rdquo; replied Teeter.
&ldquo;So your dad&rsquo;s an inventor, eh, Matson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, harvester machinery&mdash;his latest was a
corn reaper and binder, and he nearly lost it,&rdquo;
and Joe briefly told how Isaac Benjamin and Rufus
Holdney had nearly ruined his father, as related
in detail in &ldquo;Baseball Joe of the Silver Stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever hear anything more of those fellows?&rdquo;
asked Tom, following the recital of the schemes
of the plotters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they seem to have disappeared,&rdquo; answered
Joe. &ldquo;They cleared out after dad won
his case in the courts. But he&rsquo;s on the watch for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
them, he told me. His business isn&rsquo;t all settled
yet, and there is some danger. But I guess Benjamin
or Holdney won&rsquo;t bother him, though some
other rascals may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything more to eat?&rdquo; asked Peaches, during
the pause that followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you, a human refrigerator?&rdquo;
demanded Teeter. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t carry any more
pie if I tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be our treat next time,&rdquo; observed Joe.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t George Bland come with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had to bone on trigonometry, I guess,&rdquo; replied
Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he play on the team?&rdquo; Joe wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we all do. George is short, I&rsquo;m on third,
and Teeter holds down first sometimes. But you
never can tell what Hiram is going to do. He and
Luke are always making shifts, and that&rsquo;s what
lost us the Blue Banner last season. The fellows
would no more than get familiar with their positions
than Hiram would shift &rsquo;em. Oh, he runs
things to suit himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hour of ten boomed out from the big
school clock and the visitors left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spring fever!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe one day, as he
and Tom came from a physics lecture.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got it, too,&rdquo; admitted Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in
the air, and I&rsquo;m glad of it. What&rsquo;s that Shakespeare
says about &lsquo;now is the winter of our discontent?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cheese it! Don&rsquo;t begin spouting poetry.
Besides I&rsquo;m not sure it was Shakespeare, and I
don&rsquo;t give a hang. All I know is that Spring is
coming, and soon they&rsquo;ll begin getting the diamond
in shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precious lot of good that will do you&mdash;or me,
either. Hiram is as down on me as he is on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, and I was going to speak of that,
Tom. There&rsquo;s no use in your losing a chance to
play on the nine just because I&rsquo;m on the outs.
Why don&rsquo;t you cut loose from me? You can get
another room, and maybe if you do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Tom quickly. &ldquo;Do you
want me to go, old man?&rdquo; and he looked sharply
at Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Of course you know I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then drop that kind of talk, unless you want
a fight on your hands. You and I stick together,
Hiram Shell or no Hiram Shell&mdash;and Luke Fodick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; spoke Joe softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, come on; let&rsquo;s have a catch,&rdquo; proposed
Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an old ball that we used in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the Star games. Get over there and sting
some in to me. Wait until I get my glove on,&rdquo;
and he adjusted his mitt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jove! This is like old times!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe,
as he lovingly fingered the horsehide&mdash;dirty and
stained as it was from many a clouting and drive
into the tall grass and daisies. &ldquo;I wish we could
go and see a game, even if we couldn&rsquo;t play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; came from Tom, as he crouched
to receive the ball his chum was about to deliver.
Joe wound up and sent in a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; one. It landed
squarely in Tom&rsquo;s glove for the first-baseman (a
position he sometimes had played on the Stars)
was not a half bad catcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good. Not quite over the plate, but
you can get &rsquo;em there. Let &rsquo;em come about so,&rdquo;
and Tom indicated a stone that would serve for
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch this,&rdquo; requested Joe as he wound up
again and let drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A beaut!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Give me some more
that way, and you&rsquo;ll have the man out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you fellows doing?&rdquo; demanded
a voice, and the two chums looked up to see Hiram
Shell gazing at them with mingled expressions on
his fleshy face.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, having a little practice,&rdquo; replied Joe easily.
The feeling between himself and the bully
had nearly worn off, and they were on speaking,
if not on friendly terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practice for what?&rdquo; demanded Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the baseball season opens pretty soon,&rdquo;
went on Joe, &ldquo;and Tom and I sort of felt the
fever in our veins to-day. Want to have a catch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; half snarled Hiram. &ldquo;Say, did you fellows
play ball before you came here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; put in Tom. &ldquo;Joe was one of the best
pitchers on the Silver Stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Silver Stars? Never heard of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
sneered Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was only an amateur nine,&rdquo; Joe admitted
modestly. &ldquo;Tom here was first baseman, and
we had some good country games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! Maybe you came <i>here</i> to play baseball!&rdquo;
suggested Hiram with a leer. &ldquo;Seems to
me I heard that you had some such notion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have,&rdquo; asserted Joe confidently. &ldquo;I
like the game, and I&rsquo;d give a good deal to get on
the nine. So would Tom, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First base is filled,&rdquo; snapped Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about pitcher,&rdquo; asked Tom eagerly, anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to put in a good word for his chum. &ldquo;I hear
you need a new pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did; eh?&rdquo; exclaimed the bully with an
unpleasant laugh. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got another
&lsquo;hear&rsquo; coming. Besides, if there wasn&rsquo;t another
pitcher in the country, you wouldn&rsquo;t get a chance,
Matson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; queried Joe easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and a dozen times no! What, you pitch?
Say, you may have been all right on a sand-lots
team, but there&rsquo;s some class to Excelsior Hall. We
don&rsquo;t want any dubs on our nine. You think you
might pitch on <i>my</i> team? I guess nixy! We want
some fellow who can deliver the goods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe can!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, forget it!&rdquo; sneered Hiram. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;d
be knocked out of the box first inning with some of
the teams we play. You pitch! Ha! Ha! That&rsquo;s
pretty rich. I&rsquo;ll have to tell the fellows about
this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to let me pitch,&rdquo; said Joe
quietly though an angry spot burned in either
cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and you&rsquo;d better not!&rdquo; snapped Hiram.
&ldquo;You pitch! Ha! Ha! It makes me laugh,&rdquo; and
with a sneering look at Joe the bully strode off,
chuckling unpleasantly.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3>A CLASH WITH LUKE</h3>


<p>For several minutes Joe stood staring after the
baseball manager. The young pitcher&rsquo;s arm hung
listlessly at his side. There was a look on his face
that would have been sad, had Joe been that kind
of a lad&mdash;showing his feelings needlessly. But
our hero was full of spunk and grit, and, though
Hiram&rsquo;s unnecessarily cruel words hurt him grievously,
Joe shut his teeth with a firmer grip,
squared his shoulders, drew himself up, and then
he smiled at Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the mean, unmitigated, low-down,
cantankerous, sneaking, bulldozing and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
sputtered the first baseman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
blow up if you go on that way, Tom. Besides, save
some of those big words for a time when you
may need &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need &rsquo;em? Say if I don&rsquo;t need &rsquo;em now I
never will. I wish I had thought to get rid of a
few when that bully was here.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d only gotten into trouble. Better keep
still about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t Joe. Just think of it! We came here
to play ball, and the first crack out of the box that
fellow goes and tells us we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as I have any particular
right to play on the nine here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have, the best right in the world! I&rsquo;ll
bet they haven&rsquo;t got a pitcher here who can stand
up to you, and I&rsquo;m going to tell that sneaking bully
so, too,&rdquo; and Tom started off after the departing
Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Joe quickly. &ldquo;It will only
make matters worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you want to pitch; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, but that would be the best way in the
world to insure that I wouldn&rsquo;t. Hiram Shell is
just the kind of a fellow who, if he thinks a chap
wants anything, is going to do his best&mdash;or worst&mdash;to
stop him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to lie low and saw wood. The baseball
season hasn&rsquo;t opened yet. The team isn&rsquo;t
made up. Nobody knows who is going to play
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Hiram as good as told us two fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
who weren&rsquo;t going to play,&rdquo; interrupted Tom.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you and I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; advised Joe. &ldquo;I was going to
say that when the season has started and several
games have been played there may be a change.
I may get a chance to play then, just as I did on
the Stars. I&rsquo;m willing to wait. The Summer is
long, and there&rsquo;ll be more than one game. Just
say nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you say so, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo;
answered his chum, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s mighty hard to keep
still when a fellow like Hiram Shell rubs your nose
in the dirt, and then kicks you in the bargain.
He&rsquo;ll have to ask me to play now. I won&rsquo;t volunteer!&rdquo;
and Tom shook his fist in the direction of
the manager. &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;ll have to get down on
his knees and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precious little danger of that,&rdquo; remarked Joe
with a laugh. He was feeling more like himself
now, though the memory of the bully&rsquo;s sneering
words rankled. They had cut deep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;s no use catching any longer,&rdquo;
resumed Tom after a pause. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly
feel like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either. I guess we&rsquo;ve gotten over our
touch of spring fever,&rdquo; and Joe&rsquo;s voice was a bit
despondent. Really, he cared more about what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Hiram had said than he liked to admit, even to
himself. He had had high hopes when he left
the Riverside High School to come to Excelsior
Hall that he would at once become a member of
the nine. His ambition, of course, was to pitch,
but he would have accepted any position&mdash;even
out in the field, for the sake of being on the school
team. Now it seemed that he was fated not even
to be one of the substitutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you fellows up to?&rdquo; asked a voice
suddenly, and the two chums turned to behold
Peaches and Teeter walking toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we were having a catch,&rdquo; replied Tom,
&ldquo;until we got called down for it. It seems you
have to have a permit at Excelsior to indulge in
a little private practice,&rdquo; he added sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up your back now?&rdquo; asked Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, who&rsquo;s been rubbing your fur the wrong
way?&rdquo; Peaches wanted to know. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s riled
Sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you reckon would, if not Bully
Shell?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the limit,&rdquo; and he
rapidly told how Hiram had sneered at Joe&rsquo;s
efforts, and had said that he never would be on
the team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too bad, for Hiram has the inside
track,&rdquo; admitted Teeter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as sorry about it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
as you are, and so are a lot of the fellows. The
trouble is that the athletic committee is too big.
There are a lot of lads on it who don&rsquo;t care a rap
for baseball or football, who don&rsquo;t even play
tennis, yet they have a vote, and it&rsquo;s their votes
that keep Hiram as manager, and Luke as captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it be changed?&rdquo; Tom wanted to know.
Joe was maintaining a discrete silence, for he did
not want to urge his own qualifications as a pitcher.
Tom was eager to fight for his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been tried,&rdquo; spoke Peaches, &ldquo;but
Hiram has his own set with him&mdash;a set that isn&rsquo;t
the sporting element of Excelsior by a good lot,
and their votes keep him in. He spends his money
freely and toadies to them, and they fairly black
his shoes. Luke Fodick, too, helps out. He has
his crowd and they&rsquo;re all with him. I tell you it&rsquo;s
rotten, but what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m going to do if I stay here!&rdquo;
declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Peaches and Teeter
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell until I&rsquo;m ready to spring
it,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and when I do I think you&rsquo;ll see
some fur fly. How soon before the school team
is picked?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they ought to get at it pretty soon now,&rdquo;
answered Teeter. &ldquo;There is a meeting of the
athletic committee some time next week, and a
manager and captain will be elected. It&rsquo;s always
done that way here, though in some places
they do it right at the close of the season. But
it has always been a cut-and-dried affair as
long as Hiram has been here. He got in&mdash;he
and Luke&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve stayed in ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we go to that athletic meeting?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Teeter quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s open to
every lad in the school, but lots don&rsquo;t take the
trouble to go,&mdash;they know how it will turn out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe there&rsquo;ll be a different turn to it
this time,&rdquo; predicted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve got another guess coming,&rdquo;
was the retort of Peaches; and then the four
friends strolled toward the school buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to a scrub game?&rdquo; asked
Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing!&rdquo; said Joe eagerly; and so it
was arranged.</p>

<p>The school diamond was not in very good shape,
but two teams, of seven lads on a side, gathered
for the first impromptu baseball game of the season
the following afternoon. Tom, Joe, Peaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and Teeter tried to get more out, but there were
various excuses, and it might be noted that aside
from Teeter and Peaches not one of the former
regular nine appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re afraid Hiram will release
them if they play with us,&rdquo; commented Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; admitted Teeter. &ldquo;George
Bland would come only he had some experimental
work to finish. George isn&rsquo;t any more afraid of
Hiram than we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s play ball,&rdquo; suggested Joe; and the
game started. Joe occupied the box for his side,
an honor that came easily to him since none of
the others had had any experience as a twirler of
the horsehide.</p>

<p>Our hero felt a little nervous as he took his
place, for he knew he was out of practice. Also
he felt that he was being watched, not only by
his particular friends, but by others. And some
of them might not be friendly eyes&mdash;nay, some
might be spying on behalf of Hiram Shell.</p>

<p>But Joe pulled himself well together, laughed
at his idle fears, and sent in a swift curve. It
broke cleanly and completely fooled the batter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s the way to get &rsquo;em over!&rdquo; cried
Teeter admiringly from behind the bat as the
ball landed in his mitt. &ldquo;Do it some more!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; laughed Joe, and he repeated the
trick.</p>

<p>The man was easily struck out, and the next at
the bat fell for a like fate, but the third found
Joe&rsquo;s curve and swatted the ball for two bags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, Joe just allowed that so you fellows
wouldn&rsquo;t get discouraged,&rdquo; exclaimed Teeter as
an excuse for his pitcher. &ldquo;Get ready to slaughter
the next man, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Joe did. He was delighted to find that his
ability to curve the ball, and send it swiftly in,
had not deserted him during the long winter of
comparative inactivity. He knew that he could
&ldquo;come back with the goods,&rdquo; and there was a
feeling of hope welling up within him, that,
after all, there might come a chance for him to
pitch on the Excelsior nine.</p>

<p>The game went on, not regular, nor played according
to the rules by any means. But it was
lots of fun, and some of the lads discovered their
weak points, while others found themselves doing
better than they expected. Joe&rsquo;s side won by a
small margin, and just as the winning run came in
our hero was aware of a figure walking toward
the bench on which the side was sitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! Starting off rather early, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
demanded a voice, and they turned to behold Luke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Fodick. &ldquo;Who said you fellows could use the
diamond, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t ask anybody,&rdquo; retorted Teeter
with a snap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you want to&mdash;after this,&rdquo; was the surly
command. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m captain of the nine and what I
say goes. I&rsquo;m not going to have the diamond all
torn up before the season opens, see! I&rsquo;m
captain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; spoke Peaches quietly. &ldquo;The election
isn&rsquo;t until next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with it? You ain&rsquo;t
thinking of running opposition to me; are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and a bright spot burned on the fair
cheeks of the light-complexioned lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if you are you&rsquo;ll have a fight on your
hands,&rdquo; threatened Luke. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been pitching?&rdquo;
he asked, his gaze roving over the crowd
of lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was for our side,&rdquo; replied Joe quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;yes I heard about you!&rdquo; exclaimed
Luke with a grating laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the fellow
who wants to pitch on the nine; ain&rsquo;t you? Well,
you want to get that bee out of your bonnet, or
you may get stung, see? Hiram told me about you.
Why, you are only an amateur. We want the best
here at Excelsior. By Jove, it&rsquo;s queer how tacky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
some of you high school kids get as soon as you
come to a real institution. Talk about nerve,
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe fairly leaped from the bench. In another
stride he confronted Luke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; cried our hero, anger getting the
best of him for the time being. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken all of
that kind of talk I&rsquo;m going to either from you or
Bully Shell! Now you keep still or I&rsquo;ll make you.
I&rsquo;ll give you the best licking you ever had; and I&rsquo;ll
do it right here and now if you say another word
about my pitching! I didn&rsquo;t come here to take any
of your sneers, and I don&rsquo;t intend to. Now you
put that in your pipe, and smoke it, and then
close up and stay closed,&rdquo; and shaking his finger
so close to the astonished Luke that it hit the
buttons on his coat, Joe turned back and sat down.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3>&ldquo;WHO WILL PITCH?&rdquo;</h3>


<p>For a moment there was silence&mdash;a sort of
awed silence&mdash;and Teeter uttered a faint cheer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; declared Peaches.</p>

<p>Luke turned and glared at them. Afterward
several lads said the bully&rsquo;s toady looked dazed,
as if he did not understand what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go tell Hiram now, and he&rsquo;ll be laying
for you, Joe,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him. I&rsquo;m ready to meet that bully whenever
he is, and I&rsquo;m not afraid, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; exclaimed Teeter
admiringly. &ldquo;If Hiram got one good licking he
wouldn&rsquo;t be quite so uppish. But I&rsquo;m afraid this
will put you on the fritz for the nine, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it does. I&rsquo;m going to let
&rsquo;em know what I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet in the quietness of his room that night Joe
rather regretted what he had done. He realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that he might have turned off Luke&rsquo;s insult with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For if I had done so I&rsquo;d stand a better chance
of getting on the nine,&rdquo; mused Joe.</p>

<p>Then a different feeling came to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t do that either,&rdquo; he reflected.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not built that way. I&rsquo;m not going to lie
down and be walked on, nine or no nine, and I&rsquo;m
going to find some way to play ball, at that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a determined look on Joe&rsquo;s face, and
he squared his shoulders in a way that meant
business. If Hiram and his crony could have seen
our hero then they might not have been so sure of
what they would do to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how he acted, eh?&rdquo; asked the bully,
when his crony had reported to him what Joe had
said. &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll get <i>his</i> all right. He&rsquo;ll never
play ball here as long as I am manager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nor while I&rsquo;m captain,&rdquo; added Luke.
&ldquo;Nor that friend of his either, Tom Davis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; we&rsquo;ll make it so hot here for
both of &rsquo;em that they&rsquo;ll leave at the end of the
term,&rdquo; predicted Hiram.</p>

<p>What a pity he did not know that Joe and Tom
were not of the &ldquo;leaving&rdquo; kind. The hotter it
was the better they liked it, for they both came
of fighting stock.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>But with all his nerve, and not regretting in the
least what he had done, Joe was a bit uneasy as
the time for the baseball organization meeting
drew near. He hoped against hope that somehow
he might get on the team, but he did not see
how. He talked with other students, and they
all told him that Hiram, Luke and their crowd
ran things to suit themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got something up my sleeve,&rdquo; declared
Tom. &ldquo;There may be a surprise at the
meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you up to?&rdquo; asked Joe. &ldquo;Nothing
rash, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait and see,&rdquo; his chum advised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not saying anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the days went by, Tom might have been
seen talking in confidential whispers to many students.
He made lots of new friends, and it was
remarked that they were neither of the &ldquo;sporting
set,&rdquo; nor the crowd that trained with Hiram and
Luke. To all questions Tom turned a deaf ear,
and went on his way serenely.</p>

<p>It was almost a foregone conclusion as to who
would constitute the nine, with the exception of the
pitchers. As already explained, the students who,
as regular and substitute, had filled the box the
previous season had left, and it was up to Hiram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and Luke to find new pitchers. Hiram did not
play on the nine, being content to manage it, but
Luke was catcher and some of the friends of Joe
and Tom filled regular places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you dope it out?&rdquo; asked Tom of
Peaches one day, shortly before the organization
meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;ll be about like this,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;We will all gather in the gymnasium&mdash;as many
as want to&mdash;and Hiram will be in the chair. He&rsquo;ll
call the meeting to order and state what we&rsquo;re
there for, which everyone knows already, without
being told. Then he&rsquo;ll ask for nominations for
secretary, and one of his friends will go in. Then
he&rsquo;ll spout about what we ought to do to win this
season, and how to do it, and say we&rsquo;re sure to
be at the head of the league and win the Blue
Banner and all like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll ask for nominations for players and
they&rsquo;ll be voted on; we&rsquo;ll have a little chinning
about money matters, Hiram may say who the
first few games will be with, and it will be all over
but the shouting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, won&rsquo;t lots of fellows have a chance to
nominate players, or won&rsquo;t the players themselves
ask to be given a chance?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but what&rsquo;s the use? It&rsquo;s all cut and
dried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll be on the nine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can pretty near tell you, all but the pitcher.
And that will lay between Frank Brown and Larry
Akers&mdash;both friends of Hiram. Luke will catch&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a cinch. George Bland will be in centre-field.
I may be at first, though I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, because I dared to say Joe was right for
answering Luke back that time. I&rsquo;ll probably be
sent out in the daisies, but I don&rsquo;t care, for with
Luke catching it&rsquo;s no easy matter to hold down
the first bag. He throws so rotten high. Then
Teeter will be on second. Nat Pierson on third,
Harry Lauter in right, Jake Weston at short, and
Charlie Borden in left. That&rsquo;s how it will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no show for Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any, nor for you, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care about myself, but I&rsquo;m interested
in Joe. I <i>do</i> wish he could pitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Peaches with a
sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost be willing to give my place to
him, but I&rsquo;m not altogether sure that I&rsquo;ll get on the
nine, though I&rsquo;m going to make a big fight for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joe wouldn&rsquo;t think of doing anything like
that!&rdquo; objected Tom. &ldquo;But maybe my plan will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
work. If it does, Hiram won&rsquo;t have so much to
say as he does now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to gracious you can work something.
It&rsquo;s rotten the way things are now, and it is our
own fault, too. But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late to
change. No, you can figure that the nine is already
made up between Hiram and Luke&mdash;that is,
all but pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I think Joe has a chance!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give up until the last
minute. I&rsquo;m working hard for him, but don&rsquo;t say
anything to him about it. I want to surprise
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will be a disagreeable surprise,&rdquo;
commented Peaches, as he left his friend.</p>

<p>The time for the meeting was at hand and on all
sides there seemed to be but one question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will pitch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were many shakes of heads and much
speculation, but Hiram and Luke kept their own
counsel.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3>TOM&rsquo;S PLAN FAILS</h3>


<p>&ldquo;The meeting will come to order!&rdquo; called
Hiram. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cuff some of you fellows over the
head if you don&rsquo;t sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rather an unparliamentary way of doing
things, but it proved effective, and at length quiet
reigned. As Peaches had said, Hiram began by
stating what they were there for, and by announcing
that the make-up of the nine was in order.</p>

<p>Some unimportant business was disposed of,
there were remarks from several lads about what
the season might have in store, there were many
determinations expressed about how well the Excelsior
team would play that season, and then
Hiram said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nominations for the team are in order. Of
course we expect that there will be a lot more
fellows named than we can use, but there&rsquo;ll probably
be a weeding-out when we get at practice.
The team named to-night will only be a tentative
one.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Like pie!&rdquo; murmured Tom. &ldquo;You and
Luke have it all up your sleeves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the nominating committee anything to
report?&rdquo; asked Hiram, looking over at Luke.
His crony arose. Luke was chairman of the
nominating committee, as well as chairman of the
committee on membership.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your committee would recommend the following
names,&rdquo; said Luke, and then he read off
most of those named by Peaches to Tom. He
did not call off his own name, however, and there
was a blank opposite the positions of pitcher and
left field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the matter, don&rsquo;t I play?&rdquo; demanded
Peaches, jumping up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Luke quickly. &ldquo;But we
haven&rsquo;t just decided where. I&rsquo;m going to leave
that with Hiram, and also the position for left
field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll settle it right now!&rdquo; exclaimed the
manager. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll play left field, Peaches, and
Charlie Borden will move up from there to first
base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; murmured Peaches to
Tom. &ldquo;What about the stunt you were going to
pull off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t time yet. See the gang I have with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
me?&rdquo; and Tom motioned to a lot of lads in the
rear of the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it&mdash;a rough house?&rdquo; asked Peaches,
and then he noticed for the first time that the
athletic meeting was much better attended than
usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are new members,&rdquo; declared Tom in
a whisper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on turning the balance
of power away from Hiram and the crowd
with him. I&rsquo;ve been canvassing the last week,
and I&rsquo;ve got a lot of fellows to join who never
took an interest in sports before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho! So that&rsquo;s your game!&rdquo; exclaimed
Peaches. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good one all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all vote for Joe for pitcher,&rdquo; went
on Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I notice that there are still two vacancies in
the team,&rdquo; spoke Jake Weston, who had been
named as shortstop. &ldquo;We had such success with
Luke as catcher last year, that I move that he
again go behind the bat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second it,&rdquo; sung out Harry Lauter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been moved and seconded,&rdquo; began
Hiram, and there came a shout of &ldquo;ayes&rdquo; before
he had finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it always is,&rdquo; whispered
Peaches. &ldquo;Luke pretends he&rsquo;s too modest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
name himself, and some one else does it for him.
Oh, the cut-and-dried program is going through
all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; suggested Tom with a wink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the selections of the nominating committee
sanctioned?&rdquo; asked Hiram.</p>

<p>Again came a chorus of &ldquo;ayes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the pitcher?&rdquo; asked Luke. &ldquo;Will
you name him, Hiram?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the manager and he looked about
the room until his eyes lit on those of Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
name Frank Brown as regular pitcher with Larry
Akers as substitute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again came the chorus of confirmation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as I told you,&rdquo; murmured Peaches.</p>

<p>Tom was on his feet as the murmurs died
away. Hiram was speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That completes the regular nine,&rdquo; the manager
said, &ldquo;and it only remains to name the substitutes.
I think we will let them go until you
fellows have had some practice, so we can get a
line on you. There&rsquo;s time enough. We&rsquo;ll begin
regular practice next week, if the weather permits,
and then I&rsquo;ll arrange for games. I have
some in prospect, and the Blue Banner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman!&rdquo; interrupted Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; snapped Hiram. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
talking, and I don&rsquo;t want anyone to butt in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rise to a point of order,&rdquo; went on Tom, in
a loud voice. &ldquo;The nominations have not been
closed, and I want to put in nomination the name
of a friend, who is one of the best pitchers that
ever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that!&rdquo; cried Hiram. &ldquo;Get down
to business. I&rsquo;ll allow your point of order. Who
do you name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Matson!&rdquo; cried Tom, &ldquo;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t elect him, what&rsquo;s the use of trying?&rdquo;
sneered Luke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can&rsquo;t, with your crowd, but I came
here to-night with some friends of mine, new
members of the athletic committee, and they&rsquo;ll
vote for Joe, and I think we can outvote you!&rdquo;
cried Tom defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; yelled the lads toward whom
he waved his hand. &ldquo;Joe Matson for pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luke turned pale. So did Hiram as they
looked at each other. This was something they
had not counted on&mdash;an effective trick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For myself and for these new members I
demand a vote on the name of Joe Matson!&rdquo;
went on Tom, ignoring Joe&rsquo;s efforts to stop him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;we&rsquo;re for Joe!&rdquo; yelled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
new crowd. There were many of them, and with
the usual element always ready to break away
from him, Hiram knew that he would lose on the
combination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; he shouted, banging his gavel.
Then he hurried over to Luke and the two conferred
excitedly, while there was a near-pandemonium
in the gymnasium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an announcement to make!&rdquo; shouted
Hiram after a bit, making his way back to the
platform. &ldquo;It is true that you have the right to
nominate any one you please&mdash;that is, a member
of the athletic committee has, and members have
the right to vote as they please. But I have to
inform this audience that Sister Davis is not yet
a fully-qualified member of this committee. That
is not just yet.&rdquo; Hiram sneered disagreeably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? I signed my application, was
properly endorsed, and paid in my dues!&rdquo; cried
Tom. &ldquo;And so did these other fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; shouted his crowd in a chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; went on Hiram coolly. He was
master of the situation now, and he knew it.
&ldquo;But there is a rule of this organization, which
states that at the discretion of the chairman, and
the manager and captain of the team, or any
two of them, new members may be taken on probation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
for three months, and during that term of
probation they have no voting power, so you
see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an old rule!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never been enforced!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rotten!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a trick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were some of the cries that greeted the
announcement Hiram made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may never have been enforced, but it&rsquo;s going
to be <i>now</i>!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;It was made to
cover just such snap cases as this. You tried to
work a trick, Tom Davis, but you got left. You
and those other lads can&rsquo;t vote for three months,
and so the team stands as originally named.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we have no captain&mdash;your rule won&rsquo;t
work. You said the manager, chairman and captain
could apply that rule. Who is the captain?&rdquo;
demanded Tom, as he saw his game
blocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luke Fodick is captain of this nine; isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; shouted Hiram, closing the last loophole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; yelled the bully&rsquo;s crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; yelled Tom&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ayes have it,&rdquo; announced the chairman,
&ldquo;and Luke and I agreed on enforcing that rule
at this time. Besides, I am acting as chairman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in place of Henry Clay, who isn&rsquo;t present, and I
have his voting proxy, so Henry and I also agree
on it, if you question the election of Luke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ends it,&rdquo; murmured Peaches in Tom&rsquo;s
ear. &ldquo;Henry Clay never does preside as chairman.
He&rsquo;s only a figurehead for Hiram, and
that&rsquo;s well known. Hiram always votes for him.
I guess you&rsquo;re beaten Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. I wish I&rsquo;d known about that
rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten it myself,&rdquo; admitted Peaches.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rotten, but you can&rsquo;t do anything unless you
outvote Hiram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bully was smiling mockingly at Tom and
Joe. The young pitcher felt rather foolish, but
he gave Tom credit for originating a bold move
and one that, under ordinary circumstances,
would have been effective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may renew your nomination in three
months, if you like, Sister Davis,&rdquo; spoke Hiram
sarcastically &ldquo;as you and the others will then be
voting members. I believe that is about all the
business to come before us to-night.&rdquo; And he
announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3>THE BANNER PARADE</h3>


<p>Instantly following Hiram&rsquo;s words a hub-bub
burst out in the gymnasium. Everyone seemed to
be talking at once, and the crowd of boys split up
into two factions.</p>

<p>There were those who were with Joe and Tom
in their contention, and who thought that they
had not been given a fair opportunity. Among
these were, of course, the lads who had not
hitherto belonged to the athletic committee, and
who had been induced by Tom to put in their applications.</p>

<p>On the other side were what might be called
the &ldquo;conservatives,&rdquo; those who, while not exactly
favoring Hiram and his high-handed methods,
preferred to take the easiest way and let the old
order of things prevail.</p>

<p>Then, too, was a smaller crowd of distinct
&ldquo;Shellites&rdquo; as Peaches dubbed them&mdash;friends
and close cronies of the manager who sided with
him in all things and looked upon him as a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of hero. Chief among them, of course, was Luke
Fodick, and perhaps next in line stood Charlie
Borden, who had replaced Peaches at first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rotten, mean shame!&rdquo; burst out
Teeter as he came over to where Tom, Joe and
Peaches were standing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand
for it, either!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what can you do?&rdquo; asked the practical
Peaches. &ldquo;They have it on us good and proper.
There&rsquo;s the rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like it, but I&rsquo;m going to stay
here just the same,&rdquo; snapped Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; added Joe frankly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no use saying I don&rsquo;t care, for I do. I&rsquo;d like
to get on the team. But if I can&rsquo;t&mdash;why I&rsquo;ll root
for &rsquo;em, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll be picked as one of the subs,&rdquo;
was what Charlie Borden said. &ldquo;We always have
lots of them to make up the scrub nine. But
frankly, Matson, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll pitch. Frank
Brown is going to make good, and if he doesn&rsquo;t
Larry Akers will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to join some of his own particular
crowd, and with them continued the discussion of
the unexpected turn given to the athletic meeting.
Hiram and Luke were surrounded by a throng
of their cronies, and from time to time there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
could be heard from them such remarks as:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serves &rsquo;em good and right for trying to butt
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right have new fellows to try to run
our affairs for us, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sat on &rsquo;em proper, Hiram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Luke and I fixed up that scheme,&rdquo; answered
the bully, with no little pride.</p>

<p>Joe heard, and the thought came to him that
possibly there might be a split in the ranks of the
lads&mdash;a school divided against itself, and on his
account. He took a quick resolve.</p>

<p>Striding over to Hiram he held out his hand,
saying with a frank smile:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hiram, don&rsquo;t think for a minute I&rsquo;m sore.
It&rsquo;s all right, and I haven&rsquo;t a word to say. I did
want to get on the nine, but I realize that I am a
new lad here, and maybe next year things will be
different. I&rsquo;m for the team first, last and always.
Will you shake on it&mdash;you and Luke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment the bully eyed our hero. Luke,
too, gazed at him with a sneer on his face. Then
as a little murmur of admiration for Joe&rsquo;s conduct
arose&mdash;a murmur in which some of Hiram&rsquo;s
own friends joined&mdash;the latter knew that it was
the wisest policy to be at least outwardly friendly
with Joe.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Matson,&rdquo; replied Hiram. &ldquo;I
guess you can come in. I&rsquo;m sorry if you feel hurt
about the way we run things here at Excelsior
Hall, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;&lsquo;to the victors belong the spoils,&rsquo;&rdquo;
quoted Joe. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll let me play on the
scrub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, if there&rsquo;s a chance,&rdquo; put in Luke eagerly.
He, too, saw which way the wind was likely
to blow, and noting that Hiram had changed his
conduct toward Joe it was up to the bully&rsquo;s toady
to do the same. &ldquo;You can play on the scrub all
you want to,&rdquo; Luke added.</p>

<p>Hiram held out his hand and, though the clasp
he gave Joe might have been more friendly, our
hero took the will for the deed. Luke, also,
shook hands, and thus, for the time being, the
threatened breach was closed. But Joe knew, and
Hiram knew, that never could there be real
friendship between them.</p>

<p>Some of the lads began leaving the gymnasium
now. There was more talk about the coming
ball season, and some still persisted in denouncing
the high-handed methods of the manager and his
crowd. But in the main the feeling was
smothered, due chiefly to Joe&rsquo;s manly act. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
young pitcher even remained for a while chatting
with Hiram, Luke and some of their cronies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you sure did have your nerve with you,
when you shook hands with those two sneaks,&rdquo;
remarked Tom, when he and Joe reached their
room, a little later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it did take nerve, but it was the only
thing to do. I&rsquo;m a thousand times obliged to
you, Tom, for what you did for me, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what I didn&rsquo;t do for you, I guess you
mean,&rdquo; interrupted his chum with a smile. &ldquo;Well,
I meant all right, but they beat us out. But
I&rsquo;m not done trying. Joe, you&rsquo;re going to pitch
on the first nine of Excelsior Hall before this
season is over, or I&rsquo;ll eat my hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe so,&rdquo; replied Joe with
a little sigh of longing.</p>

<p>Baseball practice formally opened the next
day, which proved unexpectedly warm and springlike.
The diamond was in good shape, and a
crowd of lads turned out. A host of candidates
did their &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; and Luke and Hiram &ldquo;sized
them up.&rdquo; Joe wanted to pitch on the tentative
scrub nine that was picked to play against the
first team, but Luke, who seemed to manage the
second squad as well as the first, sent our hero
out in the field, as he also did Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; consoled Peaches, who was on
the first team. &ldquo;Luke doesn&rsquo;t captain the scrub
when it&rsquo;s formed regularly, and when the fellow
is picked out who is to have charge I&rsquo;ll speak
for you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks. I would like a chance to get in the
box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That the first nine had many weak spots was
soon made plain to captain and manager, and, to
give them credit, they at once set at work correcting
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Dr. Rudden out to give you fellows
some pointers as soon as we&rsquo;re in a little better
shape,&rdquo; said Hiram, referring to the instructor
who usually acted as coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you fellows need it all right,&rdquo; said
Tom in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody in the gym right after the game,&rdquo;
ordered Hiram, during a lull in the play. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to arrange about the Blue Banner parade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; asked Joe of Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, every year all the teams in the Interscholastic
League meet and have a parade to sort
of open the season. The nine that holds the
banner marches at the head, we have a band,
and after that a little feed and it&rsquo;s jolly fun.
You&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Morningside holds the banner now, doesn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, worse luck. It ought to come here, and
would have if Hiram and Luke had run things
differently last year. But they wouldn&rsquo;t listen to
reason. Well, I&rsquo;ve got to play ball. See you at
the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulars won the ball game by a small
margin, and then the lads trooped off to the gymnasium
to the meeting. It was much more friendly
and enthusiastic than the organization session had
been, and arrangements were quickly made for
taking part in the annual parade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As is the custom,&rdquo; said Hiram, &ldquo;we will all
meet on the grounds of the school that holds the
Blue Banner&mdash;that&rsquo;s Morningside, I&rsquo;m sorry to
say, but next season will be different. We are going
to win the Blue Banner this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he always says,&rdquo; murmured
Peaches in Tom&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we will meet on the Morningside diamond,
do the regular marching stunt and have a feed
there. It will be necessary for you fellows to
chip in for part of the expenses as our treasury
is low just now. It won&rsquo;t be much. Now the
parade committee will meet to talk over details,
and so will the rooting crowd. Get busy now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
fellows; we want to make a good showing in the
parade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Interscholastic League, of which the Blue
Banner was the trophy, consisted of these schools
beside Morningside Academy and Excelsior Hall:
Trinity School, Woodside Hall and the Lakeview
Preparatory Institute&mdash;or, more briefly the
Lakeview Prep., which I shall call it.</p>

<p>In the parade of the nines of these institutions,
and the followers of them, there were always
some novel features, and the lads tried to
outdo each other in singing, cheering or giving
their school yells. A committee generally had
charge of the cheering and yelling contingents,
and this body of students for Excelsior now got
busy making up new war-cries.</p>

<p>The day of the parade was a glorious one. It
was Saturday, naturally, as that was the only time
the students could be free. Early in the afternoon
a big crowd left Excelsior Hall, the nine
and the substitutes, including Joe and Tom, in
their uniforms, each carrying a bat as an insignia
of office. Morningside Academy was about five
miles from Excelsior, and could be reached by
trolley. Several special cars carried our hero
and his companions.</p>

<p>All the other marching contingents save Trinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
were on hand when the Excelsior lads arrived
at Morningside, and they were noisily greeted.
A few minutes later the Trinity lads arrived and
then pandemonium broke loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, this is great!&rdquo; cried Joe, as cheer after
cheer, and school-yell after school-yell, rent the
air. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have some fun after all,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure. It&rsquo;s jolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The managers of the parade were rushing
wildly to and fro, trying to get things in shape
for the start. Lads who had not seen each other
for some time were exchanging greetings, and the
members of the various nines were talking &ldquo;shop&rdquo;
to their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get in line! Get in line!&rdquo; cried the marshals.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lads were to parade around the Morningside
diamond, as a sort of tribute to the winning
team of the league, and then go down through
the town to the public square, where the yelling,
cheering and singing would take place. Then
they were to come back to Morningside for the
feast.</p>

<p>The band struck up a lively air and a silence
fell over the crowd. Then, out from the midst
of the throng came the lads of Morningside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
They were to lead the line, as was their right,
by virtue of being champions, and as they swung
into formation Joe looked at them with critical
eyes. Here was the doughty foe of his school.</p>

<p>His gaze fell upon one sturdy lad who carried
a staff&mdash;carried it proudly&mdash;and no wonder, for,
floating from it was the Blue Banner, glorious
in gold embroidery and silver lace&mdash;the Blue
Banner of the Interscholastic League&mdash;the trophy
which meant so much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Rah! &rsquo;Rah! &rsquo;Rah!&rdquo; yelled the lads. &ldquo;Three
cheers for the Blue Banner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And how those cheers welled out! The lad
carrying the banner dipped it in response to the
salute.</p>

<p>Joe felt his heart strangely beating. A mist of
tears came into his eyes&mdash;not tears of regret, but
rather tears of joy and pride, that he belonged
to the school which had a right to fight for that
banner. Ah, if he could but enter that struggle
himself!</p>

<p>Slowly the Morningside lads filed to their
places. Louder played the band. There were
more cheers, more salutes to the blue trophy, and
then the banner parade was under way.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h3>JOE HOPES AND FEARS</h3>


<p><a href="#image03">Around the Morningside diamond marched the
singing, cheering and yelling lads.</a> The Blue
Banner fluttered in the Spring breeze, and not a
student in the crowd but either hoped it would stay
in the possession of the present owners, or would
come to his school, the desires varying according
to the allegiance of the wisher.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">

<br /><span class="caption"><a href="#Page_92">AROUND THE MORNINGSIDE DIAMOND MARCHED THE SINGING, CHEERING AND YELLING LADS.</a></span>
</div>

<p>It was a gala occasion for the town of Morningside,
this Blue Banner parade, and the people
turned out in great numbers to watch the lads.
Throngs came from neighboring towns and villages,
and some even from a distant city, for the
boys could always be depended on to make the
occasion enjoyable.</p>

<p>The Excelsior Hall crowd did some new
&ldquo;stunts.&rdquo; Under the leadership of Luke and
Hiram they rendered some odd songs and yells,
and then, as they passed around the public square,
Hiram executed his main surprise. The leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of Excelsior, none other than Luke Fodick, had
been carrying a pole, on the top of which was a
canvas bundle. It was tied about with strings in
such a manner that, by pulling on one cord the
wrapping would fall off, as when a statue is unveiled.
To all questions as to what was on the
pole under the canvas Luke and Hiram returned
only evasive replies.</p>

<p>But on reaching the public square, when the
cheering was at its height, Luke pulled the string.
At once there floated from the staff an &ldquo;effigy&rdquo;
of the Blue Banner. It was made of blue calico
and worked on it in strands of yellow rope were
the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noi"><span class="smcap">We&rsquo;ll have the real banner this year!</span></p></div>

<p>Surmounting the odd trophy was a stuffed
eagle, rather the worse for being moth-eaten, and
worn &ldquo;to a frazzle,&rdquo; as Tom said. But it made
a hit, and the yells of laughter bore evidence of
how the crowd appreciated it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ve made good all right,&rdquo; said Hiram
to his crony. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else like it in
the parade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; answered Luke. &ldquo;Oh, it takes
us to do things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sometimes <i>not</i> do them,&rdquo; murmured
Teeter. &ldquo;We ought to have the real banner.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we will,&rdquo; spoke Joe.</p>

<p>The other schools had their own specialties in
singing, cutting queer capers, or in cheers, and
made hits in their own way. Around the square
marched the lads, and then, with a final chorus,
rendered by all the students, the parade was over.
Back to Morningside Academy they went, and
sat down to what the papers described later as
a &ldquo;sumptuous repast; a feast of reason and a
flow of soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jolly good fellowship prevailed at the board.
Speeches were made, toasts responded to, and
baseball talk flowed on all sides. Hiram and
Luke made remarks, as did the managers and
captains of the other nines. Predictions were
freely expressed as to who would have the banner
the next year, and then came more singing, more
cheering and more yelling.</p>

<p>The dinner broke up finally, and then the
various managers and captains got together to
arrange the Interscholastic League schedule of
games.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was all right; wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Tom
of Joe, when they were on their way back to Excelsior
Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine and dandy,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
a nice lot of fellows&mdash;all of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite some class to those Trinity School
lads,&rdquo; remarked Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a swell place&mdash;a lot
of millionaires&rsquo; sons go there I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I hobnobbed with some of &rsquo;em, and
they weren&rsquo;t a bit uppish. Right good fellows,
I thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, all millionaire lads aren&rsquo;t cads though
money sometimes makes a chap that way. Trinity
must be quite a school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it is, but Excelsior is good enough
for me. We&rsquo;re in with a dandy crowd of fellows,
though, and that makes it nice if you&rsquo;ve got
to play a lot of games with &rsquo;em. Nothing like
class when it comes to sport. We ought to have
some corking good games this Summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish you and I were more in it,&rdquo; went
on Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until we see about the scrub,&rdquo; suggested
him chum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying as much as I was
at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, though Joe thus lightly passed over the
matter, deep down in his heart there was a great
longing. To him baseball meant more than to
the average player. From the time when he had
seen his first game, as a little chap, our hero had
fairly lived, eaten and slept in an atmosphere of
the diamond. He had organized a team of lads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
when he was scarcely nine years old, and played
those little chaps in a sort of improvised circuit.</p>

<p>Then, as he grew, and developed, and found
that he could pitch, the world seemed to hold
something worth while for Joe Matson. &ldquo;Baseball
Joe,&rdquo; he had been dubbed, when as a small
chap he shouldered his bat and started off across
the lots to a game, and &ldquo;Baseball Joe&rdquo; he was
yet.</p>

<p>How he longed to be on the regular nine, even
in the outfield, none but himself knew. And
when he dreamed of the possibility that he might
some time occupy the pitching mound&mdash;well, he
had to stop short, for he found himself indulging
in a too high flight of fancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back to earth, Joe,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;If you want to pitch for Excelsior you&rsquo;ve got
to do a heap of waiting, and you are pretty good
at that game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so Joe had hopes and fears&mdash;hopes that
his dream might come true, and fears lest the
enmity of Hiram and Luke would keep him one
of the &ldquo;scrubbiest of the scrubs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was tired after the excitement of the
parade, and so was Tom, but they were not too
weary to accept an invitation to gather in the
room of Teeter and Peaches that night for a surreptitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
lunch of ginger snaps, cheese and
bottled soda water, which had been smuggled in.
And, as before, the lads took the same precautions
with the fake books and the tubes, hose
and bottles. But they were not disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to get busy next week,&rdquo; remarked
Teeter as he slowly sipped his glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard practice against the scrub starts Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s captain of the scrub; did you hear?&rdquo;
asked Peaches eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ward Gerard&mdash;a nice fellow, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried Peaches. &ldquo;Now
there&rsquo;s a chance for you, Joe. Ward&rsquo;s room is
on this corridor. I&rsquo;m going to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be caught,&rdquo; warned Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caught nothing!&rdquo; retorted his chum. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
so late none of the profs. or monitors will think
a fellow will dare go out. Ward isn&rsquo;t an early
sleeper, and I&rsquo;m going to see him and ask him
to let Joe pitch on the scrub before some one
else gets the place. I&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes,
fellows. Don&rsquo;t eat up all the grub,&rdquo; and with
that Peaches slipped noiselessly from the room.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3>ON THE SCRUB</h3>


<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take Peaches long to make up his
mind,&rdquo; remarked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s always right on the job,&rdquo; agreed
Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty good of him&mdash;and all of you&mdash;to
go to all this trouble and fuss on my account,&rdquo;
added Joe. &ldquo;I appreciate it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Teeter, as he balanced
himself on his toes to see if it was safe
to indulge in any more cheese and ginger snaps.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to do it. I only hope you do make
the team, and pitch, at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can pitch on the scrub, I&rsquo;ll be satisfied
for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to make Excelsior the best nine in
the league this year,&rdquo; went on Teeter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got to have the Blue Banner, and one way we
can cinch it is to have a good pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; laughed Joe.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean it,&rdquo; resumed Teeter, helping
himself to a handful of the crisp snaps. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
where our weak point was last season. Many a
game we gave away after we had it practically
won, just because our pitchers went up in the
air. And I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll be the same now. Frank
Brown isn&rsquo;t much, unless he&rsquo;s improved a whole
lot over season, and I don&rsquo;t believe he has. And
as for Larry Akers&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s only a makeshift.
Now, I&rsquo;d like to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Teeter&rsquo;s little talk was interrupted by the
sound of footsteps in the corridor outside. For
a moment the lads gazed anxiously at each other,
and Tom made a grab for one of the fake books,
but a look of relief came over their faces when
the door opened and Peaches entered, followed
by some one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought Ward with me,&rdquo; explained the lad
with the fair complexion. &ldquo;Thought it was the
safest way. Come on in, Ward; I guess these
Indians haven&rsquo;t scalped all the grub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, fall to,&rdquo; invited Teeter. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
plenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charmed, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; murmured Ward with
an assumed society air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Joe Matson, of course,&rdquo; went on
Peaches.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure. He beat me in physics class the
other week and I haven&rsquo;t forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants to pitch on the scrub,&rdquo; went on the
originator of the scheme. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all to the mustard,
too, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, let me say a word for myself,&rdquo; put in
Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a political candidate in the hands
of my friends. Is there a show for me on the
scrub, Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t made up the team yet, and
you&rsquo;re the first applicant for pitcher, so you&rsquo;ll
have first choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s as good as settled!&rdquo; declared
Peaches. &ldquo;When do you make up the team,
Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, I guess. I&rsquo;ll put you down as
first pitcher, Joe, and I hope you can throw a
scare into the school team&mdash;not because I&rsquo;m not
on it myself, but the better opposition they have,
the better they&rsquo;ll play for the banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Hiram?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
he kick up a fuss if he knows you&rsquo;ve got Joe?
And what about Luke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m running the scrub!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ward. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t anything to say after I
take charge. What I say goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Teeter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Hiram that much justice. He never interferes
with the scrub after the season starts. Neither
does Luke. They have their hands full managing
their own players.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I guess I&rsquo;ll get a chance to pitch,&rdquo; murmured
Joe, and he was happier than he had been
in some time. It was only a small beginning, but
it was a start, and that meant a good deal.</p>

<p>Ward Gerard, whom Joe and Tom did not
know very well, turned out to be a good-natured
and pleasant companion. He was one of the new
arrivals at the school, but already stood well in
his classes and on the athletic field. Football
was his specialty, but he was none the less a good
baseball player and might have made the first
team had he tried harder.</p>

<p>The boys talked of the diamond until the
booming of the big school clock warned them that
they had better get to bed; so with good-nights
and a renewed promise on the part of Ward to
place Joe in the box, the conference broke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, things are coming your way slowly,&rdquo; remarked
Tom, as he and Joe reached their room,
having successfully dodged a prying monitor on
the look-out for rule violators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and now I&rsquo;ve got to make good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do that easily enough. You always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
have. And when the three months are up I&rsquo;m
going to make my motion over again, and I&rsquo;ll
bet we&rsquo;ll elect you as regular pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you forget that when the three
months are up the Summer vacation will be here
and the nine will be out of business,&rdquo; remarked
Joe. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve got to work my own way, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were some murmurs of surprise when
it was announced the next day that Joe Matson
was to be the scrub pitcher. Friends of rival
candidates urged their claims on Ward, but he
stuck to his promise and the place went to Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Hiram or Luke say anything when you
told them?&rdquo; asked Tom of the scrub captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing very pleasant, so don&rsquo;t repeat it to
Joe, but Hiram wanted to know why I didn&rsquo;t
pick out a decent fellow to pitch against the first
team, and Luke remarked that Joe would be
knocked out of the box in the first practice game,
and that I&rsquo;d have to get some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Luke said that, did he?&rdquo; asked Tom,
and there was a look of smothered anger in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then some more.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait until the first game&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
requested Tom quietly. &ldquo;If they knock Joe Matson
out of the box it will be the first time it&rsquo;s
happened since he found that he was a real
pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some pretty good batters on the
first team,&rdquo; warned Ward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind Joe likes,&rdquo; replied his chum.
&ldquo;Just you wait; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the day for the first regular practice
between the scrub and first teams. For several
afternoons Joe had been pitching to Bob Harrison,
who often acted as the scrub catcher, and
as there was so much other individual playing
going on no one had paid much attention to the
work of our hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I think we&rsquo;ve got a &lsquo;find&rsquo; all right,&rdquo;
announced Bob to Ward, just before the practice
game was called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked the scrub captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that Matson can sting &rsquo;em in for further
orders, and he&rsquo;s got some of the prettiest
curves that ever came over the plate. The Hiram-Luke
crowd is going to sit up and take notice,
take it from yours truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it!&rdquo; declared Ward. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
do our best to beat &rsquo;em, and it will be for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
own good. They&rsquo;re soft, naturally at the beginning
of the season, and so are we, but if we can
wallop &rsquo;em, so much the better. Have you and
Joe got your signals down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s better at that than I am. He must
have played some pretty good games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Sister Davis says. Well, here they come.
Now to see what we can do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a conference between Luke and
Ward, and in order to give his team the most
severe kind of a try-out, Luke arranged to let
the scrub bat last.</p>

<p>The first practice game was important in more
ways than one. Not only did it open the season
for Excelsior Hall, but it would show up the weak
players, and, while the first team was practically
picked, there might be a change in it. At least
so every lad who was not on it, but wanted to be,
thought, and he hoped against hope that his playing
might attract the attention of the manager.</p>

<p>Another thing was that Dr. Rudden, the coach,
sometimes took a hand in the baseball affairs and
occasionally he had been known to over-ride the
judgment of Hiram and Luke, insisting that some
player whom they had not picked be allowed to
show what he could do on the first team. So
there were many hearts that beat high with hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and among them was Joe&rsquo;s. And there were
hearts that were a bit anxious&mdash;to wit, members
of the first team who were not quite sure of
themselves.</p>

<p>There was a large crowd in the grandstand and
on the bleachers when the gong rang to start the
game&mdash;a throng of students mostly, for the general
public was not admitted so early in the
season.</p>

<p>It was a good day for the game, albeit the
ground was a trifle soft, and the Spring wind
not as warm as might be. The boys in their
spick and span new uniforms made a natty appearance
as they trotted out on the diamond.</p>

<p>According to custom, Dr. Fillmore, the venerable
head of the school, pitched the first ball
formally to open the season. It was a sort of
complimentary ball, and was not expected to be
struck at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; yelled the umpire as he took the
new horsehide sphere from its tinfoil wrapping
and handed it to Dr. Fillmore. The president
bowed as though about to make a speech, and Joe,
who was in the box, stepped back. Our hero&rsquo;s
heart was thumping under his blouse, for at last
he was about to pitch his first game at Excelsior
Hall, even if it was but on the scrub.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h3>JOE&rsquo;S GREAT WORK</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Let her go, Doctor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him hit it, Professor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike him out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him an old Greek curve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were some of the cries that reached Dr.
Fillmore as he stood in Joe&rsquo;s place in the pitching
box. The president of the faculty smiled
pleasantly. He was used to this mild &ldquo;joshing,&rdquo;
which was always indulged in by the lads of Excelsior
on the occasion of the opening of the season.
Not that it was at all offensive; in fact, it
rather showed the good feeling existing between
the instructors and their pupils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all ready?&rdquo; asked Dr. Fillmore, as
though he was inquiring whether a student was
prepared to recite, and as if he really expected
to pitch a ball that was to be hit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called Harvey Hallock, who was
umpiring.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not too swift now, if you please, Doctor,&rdquo;
stipulated Nat Pierson, who was first up.</p>

<p>Then the venerable president delivered the new,
white horsehide sphere. He threw rather awkwardly,
but with more accuracy than might have
been expected from a man who had a ball in his
hands but once a year. Right over the plate it
went, and though usually the initial ball was never
struck at, Nat could not resist the opportunity.</p>

<p>He &ldquo;bunted,&rdquo; and the ball popped up in the
air and sailed back toward the pitcher&rsquo;s box. To
the surprise of all, Dr. Fillmore stepped forward
and neatly caught it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put him on the team!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say you were a ball-player,
Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him play the game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These and many other cries greeted the president&rsquo;s
performance. He bowed again, gravely,
and smiled genially as he tossed the ball to Joe,
who was waiting for it. A little round of applause
came from some members of the faculty who had
accompanied the doctor to the grounds, and then
the head of the school walked off the diamond
amid a riot of cheers. The baseball season at Excelsior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Hall had opened under auspicious occasions
everyone thought, and more than one lad
had great hopes that the Blue Banner would
come back there to stay for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire again, and this
time the game was on in earnest.</p>

<p>Joe dug a little hole for the toe of his shoe,
revolved the ball in his hands a few times, and
looked to get the signal from Bob Harrison, the
scrub catcher.</p>

<p>Bob, who knew the individual characteristics of
each batter better than did Joe (though the latter
was rapidly learning them) signalled for a high
out, and our hero nodded his head in confirmation.
The next instant he delivered the ball.</p>

<p>There was a vicious swing of the bat, and there
could almost be heard the swish as it cut the air.
And that is all it did do, for the horsehide landed
squarely in Bob&rsquo;s glove with a resounding ping!
and there was one strike against Nat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo; cried Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; angrily demanded
Luke Fodick of one of his best batters.
&ldquo;What do you want to fan for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help it, I guess,&rdquo; answered Bob
rather sheepishly. &ldquo;It was a curve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you know how to handle them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
this time?&rdquo; fairly snarled Hiram, who was closely
watching every player. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know how
to hit out a hot one you&rsquo;d better go back on the
scrub. Don&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill the next ball!&rdquo; declared Nat, but he
did not like the looks of it as Joe delivered it,
and did not swing his bat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; called the umpire sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what?&rdquo; cried Nat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said strike. It was right over the plate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plate nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing, calling strikes on you?&rdquo; demanded
Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks that way,&rdquo; spoke Nat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the manager in his bullying
manner, as he strode toward the umpire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on now!&rdquo; interposed Luke, who sometimes
had better judgment than Hiram. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all right. Don&rsquo;t get excited. It may have been
a strike. The fellows haven&rsquo;t got on to all the
points of the game yet this season. Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; growled Hiram. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you
dare strike out, Nat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s next delivery was called a ball, though it
was rightly a strike. Joe said nothing, realizing
that the umpire was naturally a bit afraid of offending
Hiram and Luke too much. Then Nat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
knocked a little pop fly, which was easily taken
care of by the second baseman, and the first man
on the regular, or school team, as it was called,
was out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready for the next one!&rdquo; called Catcher
Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fan!&rdquo; warned Hiram to Jake Weston,
who was next up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just watch me!&rdquo; exulted Jake as he walked
confidently to the plate.</p>

<p>Joe sent in a puzzling drop, with considerable
swiftness, but to his chagrin Jake &ldquo;killed&rdquo; it,
landing on it squarely and lining it out for two
bags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo; yelled Luke, capering
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, where&rsquo;s your star pitcher?&rdquo; inquired
Hiram, and he looked toward Tom Davis, who
was playing first. &ldquo;I guess he isn&rsquo;t so much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom said nothing. He realized that perhaps
his advocacy of Joe&rsquo;s abilities had brought his
friend and himself too much in the limelight. But
he meant well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we just let you hit that one to see
how it felt,&rdquo; shouted Bob Harrison, and that
brought back Joe&rsquo;s nerve, which, for the moment,
had deserted him as he saw his effort go for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
naught. Jake was on second, but he only got one
bag farther, stealing to third as Joe struck out
the next man.</p>

<p>The school nine members were now whispering
uneasily among themselves. Never before, at the
opening of the season had they had a scrub pitcher
who did such things to them. They realized that
they had to play the game for all it was worth.</p>

<p>Luke and Hiram were whispering earnestly together
and when Harry Lauter, whom Joe had
struck out walked to the bench, Luke stepped up
to the plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Ward Gerard quickly. &ldquo;You
are out of your turn, Luke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; indignantly demanded the
school captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Bland is up next, according to the batting
order you gave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve changed the batting order,&rdquo; put
in Hiram quickly.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that George was
not a very good hitter, while Luke was, and both
the latter and the manager had seen the necessity
of making at least one run the first inning in order
to inspire confidence in the school team. They
had hoped to change the batting order unobserved,
and bring up a good hitter when he was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
needed. But the scrub captain had been too sharp
for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed the batting order, eh?&rdquo; asked Ward.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it now under the rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we ain&rsquo;t playing strictly according
to rules yet,&rdquo; said Luke weakly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
bat, anyhow. You can change your batting order
if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; responded Ward. &ldquo;But
go ahead, we&rsquo;ll allow it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks&mdash;for nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Hiram sarcastically,
and Luke held his place at home plate.</p>

<p>The situation was now rather tense. There
were two men out, a man was on third and the
captain of the school team himself was at bat. It
was up to Luke to bring in his man and save his
side from a goose egg in the first inning. Luke
fairly glared at Joe, as if daring our hero to strike
him out, and Joe was no less determined to do
that feat if possible.</p>

<p>He looked at Bob for a signal, and got one
that meant to deliver a swift in. Then Joe knew
that Luke, for all his boasting was a bit afraid&mdash;afraid
of being hit by the ball, and, being timid
would involuntarily step back if the horsehide
seemed to be coming too close to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; murmured Joe, and he sent in
one with all his force.</p>

<p>As he had expected, the school captain did step
back, and, an instant later, the umpire cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; fairly yelled Luke turning at him.
There was a laugh from some of the scrubs, and
it was joined in by a number of the other students&mdash;lads
who were kept from the athletic committee
by the snap ruling of Luke and Hiram. The captain
realized that there was a feeling against him,
and he quickly swallowed his wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch what you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; warned Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was only a fluke,&rdquo; declared Luke.
Joe smiled. He was going to send in another
&ldquo;fluke,&rdquo; but not the same kind. He delivered a
quick ball, with a peculiar upward twist to it, and,
as Luke swung viciously at it, but too low, naturally
his bat passed under the ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo; yelled the umpire, as the ball
landed safely in Bob&rsquo;s big mitt.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of astonishment from the
school nine and its particular sympathizers, and
a breath of delight from the despised scrubs.
Hiram flushed angrily, yet he dared say nothing,
for there was no doubt about this strike. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Luke, he was too surprised to make any comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the next one!&rdquo; he declared, as he
tapped his bat on the home plate. He did hit it,
but it was only a foul, and, being on the last
strike, did not count against him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it. You&rsquo;re finding his
curves if he has any!&rdquo; cried Hiram. &ldquo;Swat it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; assented Luke.</p>

<p>With all his might he hit at the next ball, only
to fan the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike three&mdash;batter&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; called the umpire
amid a tense silence. Luke had done what he
was seldom guilty of; he had struck out, and to
a pitcher whom he not only hated but despised.
Joe&rsquo;s great work had enabled the scrub to retire
the school team without a run&mdash;a thing that had
not been done at Excelsior in many years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; yelled Tom, as he
raced in from first. &ldquo;I knew you could do it,
Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great work, old man!&rdquo; complimented Ward.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were gloomy and dubious looks on the
faces of Hiram and Luke as the school team filed
out on the field.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3>THE GAME AT MORNINGSIDE</h3>


<p>Interest, especially for Joe, centered in what
Frank Brown, the school pitcher, might do. So,
as a matter of fact, was the attention of nearly
all the players and spectators on him. For, to a
large extent, the victories of the Excelsior team
would depend on what their battery could do.
Of course it was up to the other players to lend
them support, but it was pretty well established
that if the pitcher and catcher did well, support
would not be lacking.</p>

<p>At the catching end of it Luke Fodick could be
depended on nearly every time. But Frank Brown
had yet to show what he could do as a twirler.
In practice he had made out fairly well, but now
the real test was to come.</p>

<p>Naturally he was a bit nervous as he walked to
the box, to face his first opponent, none other than
Ward Gerard, the scrub captain; and Ward was
a good hitter. He managed to hit a two bagger.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Luke and Hiram cast anxious looks at each
other. Well they knew how much depended on the
showing their pitcher would make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch yourself, Frank,&rdquo; called Hiram&mdash;just
the very advice to make poor Frank more nervous.
But he braced up, struck out the next man, and
managed to hold the succeeding one hitless.</p>

<p>The school nine was now about in the same position
as the scrub had been. Their opponents had
a man on third and two out. It was a time when
Frank needed to brace up, and repeat Joe&rsquo;s trick.
But he could not do it. Joe himself came to the
bat, and with watchful eyes picked out just the ball
he wanted after two strikes had been called on
him. He rapped out as pretty a single as had
been seen on the diamond in many a long day, and
brought in Ward with the first run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Wow!&rdquo; yelled the scrubs, capering
about. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luke and Hiram were almost in a panic. They
saw the team they had so carefully built up in
danger of disintegration; and holding a hasty conference,
warning was sent to every school player
to do his very best to get the scrub side out without
another run.</p>

<p>Frank did it, for he struck out the next man,
and Joe died at second. But the scrub had one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
run and the school nine nothing. It was a poor
beginning for Excelsior&rsquo;s chances at the Blue
Banner when the players realized what a strong
team Morningside had, and how efficient were the
other nines in the league.</p>

<p>I am not going to describe that first school-scrub
game in detail. I shall have other more
important contests to tell you about, as the story
goes on. Sufficient to say that after the ending
of the first inning Hiram and Luke went at their
lads in such a fierce spirit that there was a big
improvement.</p>

<p>Joe kept up his good work in the box, but he
had not yet &ldquo;found&rdquo; himself that season. He
was not hardened enough; he lacked practice, and
his arm soon gave out. Then, too the fielding of
the scrubs was ragged, after Joe once began
to be hit. The result was that the school nine
began to pile up runs, and Hiram and Luke were
jubilant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, where&rsquo;s your wonderful pitcher?&rdquo;
asked Luke of Ward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s coming on. No use to work him too
hard at first,&rdquo; replied the scrub captain good naturedly.
&ldquo;Look out for your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This advice was needed, for, after helping his
team to get a good lead, Frank Brown also rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
went to pieces and when the game was over the
school team led by only two runs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too close for comfort,&rdquo; observed
Hiram to Luke, as they walked off the diamond.
&ldquo;Frank has got to do better than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be all right after a little more practice,&rdquo;
spoke the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t Larry Akers will go in,&rdquo; warned
the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Well, we&rsquo;ve got lots of time before the
first Morningside game. We&rsquo;ll win that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we do,&rdquo; but Hiram&rsquo;s tone was not confident.
Somehow he was worried over the way
Joe Matson pitched.</p>

<p>As for our hero, he was warmly congratulated
by his friends. Tom Davis was particularly enthusiastic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have you in the box for the school nine
before long,&rdquo; he predicted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Joe rather dubiously.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a close combination between Hiram and
Luke, and they may get Frank Brown into shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it. He can&rsquo;t pitch as good
as you in a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; chimed in Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like having good friends,&rdquo; remarked
Joe laughingly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that the season was started the baseball
practice went on with a vim. Luke and Hiram
had some of their players out every day, batting
or catching the ball. Others were sent around
the track to improve their wind, and in the gymnasium
others were set at work on the various
machines, as Dr. Rudden found their weak spots.</p>

<p>The school nine battled against the scrub, too,
and though Joe improved in his pitching so did
the members of the first team in their batting, so
that there were no other contests as close as the
first one.</p>

<p>The time for the first Morningside game was
approaching. It was the first regular contest of
the season and as such was always quite an affair.
This time it was to be played on the Morningside
diamond, and Luke and Hiram were bending
every effort to win the game.</p>

<p>The nine picked to play was practically the same
as the one that played the first game against the
scrub. There had been some shifts, and then
shifts back again, and under the urging of the
coach, the captain and the manager, the lads had
improved very much.</p>

<p>The day of the first game came. In special
cars or in stage coaches, for those who preferred
that method of locomotion, while some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
more wealthy lads hired autos, the nine and its
supporters made their way to Morningside.
Hiram, Luke and a few of their cronies went in
a big touring car that Spencer Trusdell, a millionaire&rsquo;s
son, owned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some class to them,&rdquo; remarked Joe, as he and
Tom with a squad of the scrub and substitutes,
got aboard a trolley car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may have to walk back,&rdquo; predicted
Tommy Barton, one of the scrub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spencer may not have money enough left to
buy gasolene. He&rsquo;s a sport, you know, and always
betting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll bet on his own nine; won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and Tommy paused significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you think Morningside
will win, do you?&rdquo; asked Ward Gerard.
&ldquo;You old traitor, you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see our side licked,&rdquo;
replied Tommy calmly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re soft, and Morningside
has already played one game with Trinity
and trimmed them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as Joe and Tom journeyed to the grounds
they heard others say the same thing. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Luke, Hiram and their own particular crowd
were very confident.</p>

<p>There was a big attendance at the game. The
stands were filled with a rustling, yelling, cheering
and vari-colored throng&mdash;the colors being supplied
by scores of pretty girls, whose brothers, or
whose friends, played on either nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jove! What wouldn&rsquo;t I give to be booked to
pitch to-day!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, as he and Tom
found their seats, for neither was on the list of
substitutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know how you feel, old man,&rdquo; sympathized
Tom. &ldquo;But just hang on, and things may come
your way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; cried the umpire, and the first
big game of the season for Excelsior Hall was
underway.</p>

<p>That contest is still talked about in the annals
of the two schools. It started off well, and Excelsior,
first to the bat, rapped out two runs before
the side was retired. Then came the first real intimation
that the opponents of Morningside were
weak in several places, notably in the pitching box,
and in fielding and stick-work.</p>

<p>Frank Brown, after striking out two men in
succession, and giving the impression to his mates
that he was going to make good, and to his rivals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that they had a strong boxman to fight against&mdash;Frank,
I say, literally went up in the air.</p>

<p>He was not used to being hooted at and jeered,
and this is just what the Morningsideites did to
him to get his &ldquo;goat.&rdquo; They got it, for before
the first inning closed he had been unmercifully
pounded, and four runs were chalked up to the
credit of the foes of Excelsior Hall.</p>

<p>Still that score might not have been so bad had
Hiram and Luke kept their heads. They changed
their batting order, put in some substitutes, and
Hiram used strong language to Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to do better!&rdquo; insisted the bullying
manager. This had the further effect of getting
on Frank&rsquo;s nerves, and he did worse than
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, why don&rsquo;t you fellows get a real
pitcher?&rdquo; asked Halsted Hart, manager of the
Morningsides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too easy,&rdquo; added Ted Clay, the opposing
pitcher with a laugh.</p>

<p>In desperation Luke finally sent in Larry Akers
to pitch. At first he tightened up and stopped the
winning streak of Morningside, and then, he, too,
fell by the wayside, and the hooting, yelling crowd
had his &ldquo;Angora,&rdquo; as Peaches dolefully remarked.</p>

<p>It might be said in passing that both Peaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and Teeter did well, and George Bland not quite
so well. But the rest of the Excelsior team made
many errors. Even Luke was not exempt, and
this had the further effect of worrying his players.</p>

<p>It is no pleasure to write of that first game, and
that is why I have not gone into details about it,
for Excelsior Hall is a school dear to my heart,
and I do not like to chronicle her defeats.</p>

<p>When the ninth inning came the score stood
fourteen to six. In desperation, Luke had sent in
Ned Turton to replace Larry. Several of his own
friends asked him to give Joe a chance, but neither
he nor Hiram would listen. In fact, there was a
disagreement between Hiram and Luke. The
manager wanted to shift Peaches back to first base
but Luke would not hear of it until Hiram threatened
to resign as manager, and that so alarmed
the captain that he let him have his way.</p>

<p>That settled matters, not because Peaches went
to first, though he did good service there, but it
was too late to stem the losing tide. The Excelsior
team could not get a run in their share of the
ninth, and Morningside did not take the trouble
to finish out, the final score being fourteen to six
in their favor. The opponents of Excelsior had
snowed them under.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3>A STRANGE DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Excelsior Hall!&rdquo; cried
Captain Elmer Dalton of the Morningside team.
&ldquo;All ready boys, with a will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cheers were deafening and perhaps they
were all the more hearty because it was the winning
nine and its supporters who were giving them.</p>

<p>The crowd swarmed over the diamond, players
and spectators mingling. Everybody was talking
at once, the losing side and their supporters trying
to explain how the defeat had come about, and
the victors exulting in their victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s the matter with you fellows,
anyhow,&rdquo; growled Hiram, as he strode over and
joined the little group of disconsolate ones who
were walking toward the dressing room. &ldquo;You
ought to have beaten &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so we would have if they&rsquo;d given me decent
support,&rdquo; broke in Luke. &ldquo;There were too
many changes on the team.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you think I&rsquo;m responsible for
that,&rdquo; retorted Hiram quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so. One thing, though; there&rsquo;s
got to be another change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added the manager scowling at
the team, but neither he nor Luke intimated where
the change ought to be made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re right on that one point,&rdquo; said Peaches,
&ldquo;a big shift is needed, and I can tell &rsquo;em one
place to make it, if not two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitcher for one,&rdquo; replied Peaches quickly,
&ldquo;and catcher for the other. If we had two good
men as a battery there would have been a different
story to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; quickly demanded Hiram, turning
around, for Peaches had unconsciously spoken
louder than he intended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I agreed with you,&rdquo; spoke the lad diplomatically,
&ldquo;that if we&rsquo;d had some changes
the result would have been different to-day,&rdquo; but
he did not mention the changes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; remarked Joe to Tom, as
they descended from the grandstand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
back home. Jove! But it&rsquo;s too bad to start the
season with a defeat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody had to lose,&rdquo; replied Tom philosophically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t both win, and I didn&rsquo;t
expect it would turn out much different when I
heard the talk on the way to the game. But it
will teach Luke and Hiram a lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they want to learn it&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry. They&rsquo;ll be only too anxious,
after to-day. But I notice some of the Trinity
Hall and Lakeview Prep. players here. Getting
a line on us, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. We play Trinity next
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we ought to win that game. Hurry up,
Joe, and we can get the next trolley back. No
autos for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the two chums hurried across the diamond
they found themselves in the midst of a crowd of
Morningside players and students. At the sight
of one lad in the uniform of Morningside, a uniform
not soiled by the dust and grime of the diamond,
Tom plucked Joe by the sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike, look there!&rdquo; exclaimed
the former first baseman of the Silver Stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Joe, and Tom pointed to
the player in the spick and span new uniform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam Morton!&rdquo; gasped Joe, as he recognized
his former rival on the Stars and his sometime
enemy. &ldquo;Sam Morton! What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as if he was on the nine,&rdquo; replied Tom.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in one of the Morningside uniforms, but
he didn&rsquo;t take part in the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam Morton here!&rdquo; went on Joe, wonderingly.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible. I wonder why
we didn&rsquo;t hear something about it? It sure is he,
and yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll ask some one,&rdquo; volunteered Tom,
and tapping on the shoulder a Morningside player
near him, he asked: &ldquo;Is he one of your nine?&rdquo;
Tom pointed to Sam Morton, who had not yet observed
our heroes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Oh, yes; he&rsquo;s a newcomer here I believe,
but he had quite a reputation, so Captain
Dalton put him on as substitute pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Substitute pitcher!&rdquo; gasped Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s rather good I believe. He hasn&rsquo;t
had much practice with us as yet or we&rsquo;d have
played him part of the time against you fellows
to-day. Why, do you know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He used to be on the same town team
with me,&rdquo; replied Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably play next week,&rdquo; went on the
Morningside lad, &ldquo;and when we meet you fellows
again he&rsquo;ll probably do what Ted Clay did to-day,&rdquo;
and he grinned cheerfully&mdash;there is nothing
like a cheerful enemy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam Morton here,&rdquo; murmured Joe, as if unable
to believe it, while his old enemy strode on
without having seen him, and the Morningside
lad, who had given them the information swung
about on his way to the dressing rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s going some!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, as
he and Tom walked on. &ldquo;Fancy meeting Sam
Morton here. I didn&rsquo;t hear that he was going
to boarding school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither did I. He must have made up his
mind lately. Probably he began right after the
Easter vacation. I didn&rsquo;t spot him at the time of
the banner parade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, either. But there was such a mob of
fellows that it was hard to find anyone. But if
he&rsquo;s here and he makes good, and pitches in some
of the games, and if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you get the chance to pitch for the school
nine, you and Sam may fight your old battles over
again,&rdquo; finished Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Joe.</p>

<p>It was a discouraged, disgruntled and altogether
unhappy crowd of lads that returned to
Excelsior Hall late that afternoon. Despondency
perched like a bird of ill-omen on the big flagstaff;
and a celebration that some of the lads had arranged
for, in case of a victory, did not come off.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom and Joe were seated in their room, talking
over various matters, including the game of
the day, when there came the usual signal on their
door, indicating that a friend stood without.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Teeter,&rdquo; predicted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peaches,&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s guess, but when he swung
open the portal both lads stood there. On their
faces were looks of suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; demanded Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots. Special meeting of the athletic committee
called. In the gym. Come on!&rdquo; panted
Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to protest against the way
Hiram manages the team!&rdquo; added Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; urged Peaches, recovering his
breath. &ldquo;We want you with us. There&rsquo;s a lot
of feeling against Hiram and Luke. They practically
lost the game for us to-day. The revolt is
spreading. It&rsquo;s a chance for you, Joe. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a hot time!&rdquo; predicted
Teeter. &ldquo;We have permission to hold a meeting.
All the fellows are coming. Get a move on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe and Tom grabbed up their caps and hurried
after their chums, Joe with a wildly-beating heart.
Had his chance come?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3>A HOT MEETING</h3>


<p>&ldquo;The meeting will come to order!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Teeter was in the chair, looking over a talking,
shifting, excited crowd of lads gathered in
the school gymnasium. He had assumed the office,
and no one had disputed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The meeting will come to order!&rdquo; he cried
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo; begged George Bland and
Peaches. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Tommy
Barton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try and fix things so we can win ball games,&rdquo;
answered Tom Davis.</p>

<p>Joe did not say much. He realized that this
was, in a measure, a meeting to aid him, and he
felt it would be best to keep quiet. His friends
were looking out for his interests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo; begged Teeter again, and
after many repetitions, and bangings of his gavel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
he succeeded in producing some semblance of
quietness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all know what we&rsquo;re here for,&rdquo; went on
Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t; tell us!&rdquo; shouted some one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here in the first place to make a protest
against the way Hiram Shell and Luke Fodick
managed the baseball team to-day,&rdquo; went on
Teeter, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll consider what can be
done to make things better. We ought to have
won against Morningside to-day, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit &rsquo;em again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were a few of the cries that greeted
Teeter&rsquo;s announcement. He was very much in
earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a regular session of the athletic
committee at all,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a protest
meeting, and it&rsquo;s going to be sort of free and
easy. Any fellow that wants to can speak his
mind. I take it you all agree with me that we
ought to do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; came in a chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we ought to protest against Hiram&rsquo;s
high-handed method. What about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, too,&rdquo; responded several. Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
looked over the crowd. As far as he could see
it was composed in the main of lads who were
only probationary members of the school society&mdash;lads
without voting power.</p>

<p>Neither Hiram nor Luke was present, and
Joe could not see any of their particular crowd.
He was mistaken in thinking that Hiram had no
friends there, however, for no sooner had Teeter
asked the last question than Jake Weston arose
and asked in rather sneering tones:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you call this giving a fellow a square
deal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Teeter. The
room was quiet enough now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean just this,&rdquo; went on the lad who was
perhaps the closest of all on the nine to Hiram
save Luke. &ldquo;I mean that Hiram Shell isn&rsquo;t here
to defend himself, and you&rsquo;re saying all sorts of
mean things against him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We intend to have him here&mdash;if he&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo;
spoke Teeter significantly. &ldquo;Luke, too. We want
them to hear what we say about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to disrupt the team!&rdquo; yelled
Jake, who had lost his temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not! I&rsquo;m trying to do anything to
better the team. We ought to have won that
game to-day, and you know it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that I played my best!&rdquo; shouted Jake,
&ldquo;and if you accuse me of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s accusing you,&rdquo; put in Peaches.</p>

<p>Several lads were on their feet, all seeking to
be heard. Teeter was vainly rapping with his
gavel. It looked for a few moments as if there
would be several fights, for lads were shaking
their fists in each other&rsquo;s faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give Hiram a show?&rdquo; demanded
Jake. &ldquo;Let him know this meeting is
being held.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent word to him, but he didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo;
called Teeter, above the din.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s here now!&rdquo; interrupted a sudden
voice, and Hiram Shell fairly jumped into the
room, followed by Luke and a score of their particular
friends. &ldquo;I just heard of this snap session,
and I want to know what it&rsquo;s about. How
dare you fellows hold a meeting of the athletic
committee when I didn&rsquo;t call it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you drop that kind of talk!&rdquo; fairly
yelled Teeter. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a meeting of the athletic
committee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on down off that platform!&rdquo; demanded
the bully striding toward the chairman <i>pro tem</i>.
&ldquo;What right have you got there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as much right as you have, and I&rsquo;m going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to stick! This is just a meeting of the fellows
of Excelsior Hall, and I&rsquo;ve got just as much right
to preside as you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the gavel which Teeter clenched
in his hand, perhaps it was the fearless manner
in which he faced Hiram, or perhaps it was the
way in which Joe, Tom, Peaches and several of
the larger students crowded up around Teeter,
like a bodyguard, that caused Hiram to pause in
his progress toward the chairman.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it proved effective and probably
prevented a serious clash, for Hiram was in
the mood to have struck Teeter, who surely would
have retaliated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; asked the bully,
after a pause. &ldquo;What do you fellows want, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want the ball team managed differently,&rdquo;
retorted Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; came from a score of ringing
voices.</p>

<p>Hiram turned a bit pale. It was the first time
he had ever witnessed an organized revolt against
his authority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you fellows satisfied with the way I
manage things?&rdquo; the bully sneered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and not with the way Luke Fodick captains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the team,&rdquo; went on the now fully aroused
Teeter. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s got to be a change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re sore because some of your friends
can&rsquo;t play!&rdquo; cut in Jake Weston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; spoke Teeter. &ldquo;Everyone
knows we should have won to-day, and what a
miserable exhibition of baseball we gave! It was
rotten, and we want to protest. We&rsquo;re willing to
let you continue as manager, Hiram, and have
Luke for captain, only we fellows want to have
more of a say in how the team is run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you fellows haven&rsquo;t any rights!&rdquo; cried
Hiram. &ldquo;A lot of you are only probationary
members, anyhow, and can&rsquo;t vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need to vote,&rdquo; declared Teeter.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of voting. We&rsquo;re students
at Excelsior&mdash;all of us&mdash;and we have a right to
say what we think. We think things ought to be
done differently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;we&rsquo;re with him,&rdquo; was shouted
in such a volume of energy that it clearly showed
to Hiram that, even though he held the balance
of power in the committee proper, yet he did not
in the whole school, and it was to the whole school
that the team would have to look for support. It
was a crisis in the affairs of Excelsior Hall.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3>THE INITIATION</h3>


<p>For a moment after the unexpected support of
Teeter&rsquo;s ultimatum to Hiram there was a tense
silence. The lads who had come in with the bully&mdash;his
supporting army so to speak&mdash;remained
grouped around him and Luke. On the other side
stood Teeter, Peaches, Tom, Joe and their friends,
and a number of the better players of the school
nine. Included among them were a number of the
substitutes.</p>

<p>Hiram Shell looked around him. He must
have been aware that his power might slip very
easily from him now, unless something was done.
It was no time to pursue his usual tactics. He
must temporize, but he made up his mind that
those who had revolted from his authority would
pay dearly for it sooner or later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you fellows want?&rdquo; he fairly
growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we want,&rdquo; said Teeter firmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
&ldquo;In the first place we want this business of
shifting players all about, stopped. A fellow gets
used to playing in one position and he&rsquo;s best there.
Then you or Luke change him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hasn&rsquo;t the captain the right to do
that?&rdquo; demanded Luke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, yes,&rdquo; spoke Peaches, &ldquo;but when you get
a good lad in a good place keep him there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; sneered Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we think there ought to be better pitching,&rdquo;
went on the self-constituted chairman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! I guess that&rsquo;s where the whole trouble
is!&rdquo; cried Hiram quickly. &ldquo;This meeting is for
the benefit of Joe Matson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe quickly.
&ldquo;I knew nothing about it until Teeter told me.
Of course I&rsquo;d like to pitch; there&rsquo;s no use denying
that, but I don&rsquo;t want any fellow to give way for
me if he&rsquo;s making good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; put in Teeter.</p>

<p>Hiram took a quick resolve. He could smooth
matters over now, and later arrange them to suit
himself and Luke. So he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I admit that we didn&rsquo;t make a very
good showing to-day. But it was our first game,
and Brown and Akers didn&rsquo;t do very well in the
box. But don&rsquo;t be too hasty. Now I&rsquo;ll tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; and he acted as though it was a big
favor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you fellows have a voice when I
make changes after this. We&rsquo;ll do some harder
practice. I&rsquo;ll make Brown and Akers pitch
better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he can,&rdquo; murmured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t make any more shifts&mdash;right
away,&rdquo; went on Hiram. &ldquo;Maybe you fellows
were right. I haven&rsquo;t given as much time to the
team as I should. But wait&mdash;we&rsquo;ll win the Blue
Banner yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all we ask,&rdquo; said Teeter. &ldquo;We just
wanted you to know how we felt about it, and if
things are better and our nine can win, we won&rsquo;t
say another word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, let it go at that,&rdquo; and Hiram affected
to laugh, but there was not much mirth in it.
&ldquo;Might as well quit now, I guess. Everybody
out for hard practice next week. I want to see
some better stick-work, and as for pitching&mdash;where
are Brown and Akers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried the two boxmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellows will have to brush up a bit on
your speed and curves,&rdquo; went on the bully manager.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right, Luke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; grunted the captain. There was more
talk, but it was not of the fiery kind and, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
time, at least, the threatened disruption had
passed. But there was still an undercurrent of
dissatisfaction against Luke and Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see as it did an awful lot of
good,&rdquo; remarked Tom Davis to Peaches and
Teeter, as they walked out of the gymnasium with
Joe, a little later. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that Joe is benefitted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect much,&rdquo; spoke our hero. &ldquo;It
was well meant and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it did good, too,&rdquo; interrupted Teeter.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time any one ever talked to Hiram
like a Dutch Uncle, and I guess it sort of jarred
him. He&rsquo;ll sit up and take notice now, and it
will be for the good of the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where does Joe come in?&rdquo; asked Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I figure it out this way,&rdquo; replied Teeter.
&ldquo;Brown and Akers will try to make good but they
can&rsquo;t. The fellows will see that we&rsquo;ve got to
have a new pitcher, and Hiram will have to give
&rsquo;em one. Then Joe will step in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are others as good as I in the school,&rdquo;
remarked Joe modestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they haven&rsquo;t shown themselves if there
are,&rdquo; was Teeter&rsquo;s retort. &ldquo;No, Joe will be
pitching before the season is over, you see if he
isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The question was discussed pro and con, as
they went to their rooms, and continued after
they got there until a monitor warned them that
though permission had been given to hold a meeting
it did not extend to midnight lunch.</p>

<p>It was one night, after a hard day on the diamond,
that Joe and Tom, who were studying,
or making a pretense at it, heard the usual knock
on their door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teeter and Peaches&mdash;I wonder what&rsquo;s up
now?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em in and they&rsquo;ll tell us,&rdquo; suggested Joe,
as his roommate went to the door. It was kept
locked, for often some of the fun-loving students
would come in unannounced to create a &ldquo;rough-house,&rdquo;
to the misery of the two chums.</p>

<p>As the portal swung back, there was revealed to
Joe and Tom several sheet-clad white figures, each
one with a mask of black cloth over his head. The
sight was rather a weird one, and for the moment
Tom was nonplussed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut the door,&rdquo; commanded Joe quickly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re up to some high jinks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom hesitated for a moment. If it was Peaches,
Teeter and their friends, he did not want to shut
them out, but, on the contrary might want to join
the fun. If, on the contrary, it was a hostile crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
there was no use getting into trouble. So Tom
hesitated and was lost.</p>

<p>For a moment later, the throng of white-clad
and unrecognizable figures (because of the masks)
stepped into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have come,&rdquo; announced one in a voice that
sounded hollow and deep, &ldquo;to initiate you into
the Mystic and Sacred Order of the Choo-Choo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, Peaches, I know your voice,&rdquo; said
Joe, not quite sure whether he did or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prepare to join the Mystic and Sacred Order
of the Choo-Choo! Shall he not, comrades?&rdquo;
demanded a second figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toot! Toot! He shall!&rdquo; was the answer in
a chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Teeter all right,&rdquo; affirmed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; commanded the first figure, advancing
to take hold of Tom&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go, Joe?&rdquo; asked his chum.</p>

<p>Joe thought a minute. There had been rumors
in the school of late, that several initiations had
been held into a newly-formed society. Reports
differed as to what society it was, some lads stating
that they had been made to join one and some
another. But all agreed, though they did not go
into particulars, that the initiations were anything
but pleasant. Joe was as fond of fun as anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
but he did not like being mistreated&mdash;especially
when it was not by his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; he called suddenly to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll make you!&rdquo; said the disguised
voice. &ldquo;Grab &rsquo;em fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly there was a commotion in the room.
Joe leaped back to get behind a sofa, but one of
the black-masked figures was too quick for him
and seized him around the neck. Our hero tried to
tear the mask from the face to see who his assailant
was, but other hands clasped his arms
from behind and he was helpless.</p>

<p>Tom, too, was having his own troubles. He
was beset by two of the unknowns and held in
such a way that he could do nothing. The struggle
though sharp was a quiet one, for the students did
not want to attract the attention of a monitor or
prowling professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; spoke the lad who was evidently
the leader, when Tom and Joe were held safely,
their hands having been tied behind their backs.
&ldquo;Away with them to the dungeon deep, and they
will soon be good, faithful and true members of
the Mystic and Sacred Order of the Choo-Choo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, realizing that discretion was probably
now the better part of valor, Joe and Tom meekly
followed their captors.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>&ldquo;FIRE!&rdquo;</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Where are you fellows taking us?&rdquo; demanded
Joe, as they walked softly down the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toot-Toot!&rdquo; was all the answer he received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, we don&rsquo;t mind having fun,&rdquo; added Tom,
&ldquo;but if you fellows are going to cut up any, we
want to know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toot-Toot!&rdquo; came again in imitation of a
whistle. It was evident that this was a sort of
signal or watchword among the members of the
Order of Choo-Choo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t Peaches, Teeter, and our fellows,&rdquo;
spoke Joe into Tom&rsquo;s ear as they were
forced to descend a back and seldom used staircase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;I wonder who
they are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the seniors, maybe,&rdquo; suggested the
young pitcher. &ldquo;I wish I knew where they are
taking us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The candidates who are about to be initiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
into the Mystic and Sacred Order of the
Choo-Choo will kindly keep quiet!&rdquo; came the
quick command from the leader. &ldquo;Silence is imperative
to have the spell work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dry up!&rdquo; retorted Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; came the command again, emphasized
this time by a dig in the ribs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You quit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began our hero, but his voice
ended in a grunt, for some one had hit him in the
stomach, knocking the wind out of him. He was
indignant, and had half a mind to make a fight
for it then and there. But he was practically helpless,
and was descending a flight of stairs which
made it dangerous to chance a scuffle. He made up
his mind to fight when the time came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you fellows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence over there!&rdquo; hissed one of the white-robed
figures. &ldquo;If they talk any more, Master
of Ceremonies, gag &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, Chief Engineer,&rdquo; was the hollow
answer.</p>

<p>Tom thought it best to keep quiet. Silently the
little crowd advanced. They halted at the door
of one of the many store-rooms in the basement
of the largest of the school dormitories. One of
the lads opened the portals with a key. It was
as black as pitch beyond.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Enter, timid and shrinking candidates,&rdquo; commanded
some one. &ldquo;Enter into the sacred precincts
of the Choo-Choo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared Joe. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see my hand before my face, and I&rsquo;m not going
into a dark room, not knowing what is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either!&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so ordered,&rdquo; came the deep voice of the
leader. &ldquo;Enter or be thrown in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe turned, trying in vain to pierce the disguise
of the black mask. He struggled to free
his arms from the rope that bound them, but could
not. He was half-minded to strike out with his
feet, but he was now so surrounded by the initiators
that he could not. Besides, if he did that
he might lose his balance and fall hard. Tom
was in like straits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forward, march!&rdquo; came the command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going in I tell you!&rdquo; insisted Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t go in, shove him,&rdquo; came the
command.</p>

<p>Joe, as he felt that resistance was useless,
started forward. It was better to keep his own
footing, if he had to go in the room and not run
the risk of being shoved down.</p>

<p>Advancing cautiously, followed by Tom, the
young pitcher stepped over the threshold. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
instantly he felt cold water spurting up around his
ankles, and he sought to draw back. He did not
want to fall into a deep tank, with his arms bound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on in!&rdquo; was the command and he
felt himself being shoved from behind. There
was no help for it, but to his relief he found, as
he advanced, that the water did not come higher
than his knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! What are we up against?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; responded Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence! Blindfold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; came a command,
and before they could have prevented it, had they
been able, Joe&rsquo;s and Tom&rsquo;s eyes were covered
with big handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on!&rdquo; was the order again, and the candidates
did, soon stepping out of the water upon
the solid floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tie their feet,&rdquo; was the next order, and this
was done. &ldquo;Now, candidates,&rdquo; spoke the leader,
&ldquo;you have crossed the river of blood and the first
part of your journey is over. But, to be good and
loyal members of the Mystic and Sacred Order
of Choo-Choo, it is necessary that you make a
noise like a locomotive. Go ahead now, puff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Joe and Tom hesitated and then,
absurd as it was, they entered into the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the affair and gave as good an imitation as possible
of a steam locomotive in operation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good! Very good,&rdquo; was the comment.
&ldquo;Now go up grade,&rdquo; and the blindfolded candidates
were forced to go up a steep incline of
boards, slipping and sliding back half the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are coming on,&rdquo; commented some one.
&ldquo;At the next stop they take water. Hose-tender,
get ready!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on! What are you going to do?&rdquo; demanded
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; was the answer. Joe and Tom
were led to another part of the room. It was
dimly lighted now, as they could see, for a faint
glow came under the handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>A moment later each of the luckless candidates
felt a cold stream of water strike him full in the
face. They tried to duck, and to turn their heads
away, but the others held them until the upper
part of their bodies were thoroughly soaked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for steam,&rdquo; came the order
from one of the party. &ldquo;Now to see how they
can carry passengers. Off with their bonds, but
keep the blinders on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down on your hands and knees, candidates,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
came the order, and Joe and Tom had nothing for
it but to obey.</p>

<p>A moment later some one sat on each back
and again came the order:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forward march!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Joe, while liking fun as well as any lad,
thought there was a limit to it, and to the indignities
of the initiation, especially in a mythical
society which they did not care about joining.
When a heavy lad, therefore, sat down on our
hero&rsquo;s back Joe made up his mind that matters
had gone far enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead! Carry your passenger!&rdquo; was the
command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by a jugful!&rdquo; cried Joe, and with a
quick motion he stood up, spilling off the lad on
his back. The latter hit the floor with a resounding
whack. The next instant Joe had torn off the
blinding handkerchief, and made a grab for the
lad whom he had upset. He tore off his mask
and there was revealed the scowling face of Hiram
Shell.</p>

<p>At the same moment Tom had done the same
to his tormentor, discovering Luke Fodick under
the black mask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s your crowd, is it Hiram?&rdquo; asked
Joe.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and by Jove, you&rsquo;ll suffer for this! Why
aren&rsquo;t you sports enough to take your initiation as
the others do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we don&rsquo;t choose to,&rdquo; replied our hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make you!&rdquo; cried Hiram, doubling
up his fists and leaping at Joe. &ldquo;Come on, Luke,
give &rsquo;em what&rsquo;s coming to &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two can play at that game,&rdquo; spoke Joe coolly.
He noted that the room had been roughly fitted
up as a sort of society meeting chamber. At the
entrance was a long, narrow and shallow tank of
water. It was through this that Joe and Tom
had waded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you!&rdquo; cried Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Joe easily. &ldquo;As well here
and now as anywhere, anytime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw himself into a position of defense as
Hiram came on. Luke was advancing toward
Tom, while the others, still wearing their masks,
looked on in anticipation.</p>

<p>There might have been two stiff fights the next
moment had there not suddenly sounded from
without a series of startled cries. Then came the
clanging of bells, and above the riot of noise the
lads heard some one shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Fire!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h3>A THRILLING RESCUE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked half a dozen of the
white-robed lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire, somewhere,&rdquo; answered Hiram, pausing
in his rush toward Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, this can wait,&rdquo; added one of his
companions. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re through with this initiation,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not through with him,&rdquo; snapped the
bully with a glance of anger at the young pitcher.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle with him later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the cries rang out on the night air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The school must be on fire!&rdquo; yelled Luke Fodick.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many voices now took up the cry outside, and
through a partially-curtained window could be seen
the dancing light of flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Joe to Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to be in on this, whatever it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know,&rdquo; agreed his chum.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>They rushed from the room, following after
Hiram and Luke. The others straggled out as fast
as they disrobed, for they did not want to be seen
in their regalia by any of the school authorities
who might be on hand after the alarm of fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t any of the school buildings!&rdquo;
exclaimed Joe as he and Tom raced along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. So do I. Look, you can see
the reflection from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were opposite a window in the corridor,
and over the roof and spire of the school
chapel could be seen a lurid glare in the sky, but
what was burning could not be made out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the gym!&rdquo; gasped Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare say that!&rdquo; cried Joe, &ldquo;and
with the baseball season just starting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks like it anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Together they raced on until they came to a
door that gave egress to the campus. Students
were pouring out from their rooms in all directions,
some eagerly questioning, and others joining
in the cries of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; No one seemed to
know where the blaze was.</p>

<p>Professor Rodd came out with his precious tall
hat in one hand and a bundle of books in the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the school doomed, boys?&rdquo; he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
&ldquo;How did it start? Have I time to save anything
else? I have some Latin books&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where it is, Professor,&rdquo; answered
Joe. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t this building, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;m glad of it. I mean I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s
anywhere. Wait, and I&rsquo;ll be with you to help
fight the flames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran back to his quarters to return quickly
minus his silk hat and the books, and he wore an
old fashioned night-cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he announced, and he
ran on as though he had donned a modern smoke
helmet, used by the firemen. The boys laughed,
serious and exciting as the situation was.</p>

<p>Dr. Rudden saw our two friends hurrying
across the campus together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, boys!&rdquo; cried the coach and athletic director.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all wet! How did it happen?
Have you been playing the hose on the fire? Did
it burst?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t been to the blaze yet,&rdquo; answered
Joe. &ldquo;We had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sort of accident,&rdquo; finished Tom, as his chum
hesitated for the right explanation. Then they
avoided further conversation by racing toward the
blaze, the light of which was becoming every minute
more glaring.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>A stream of students and teachers was now hurrying
across the campus, heading for the path
around the chapel, which building hid the fire from
sight. As Tom and Joe turned the corner they
saw at a glance what was burning.</p>

<p>It was an old disused factory about half a mile
from the school, a building pretty much in ruins
and of little value save as a sleeping place for
tramps. Several times in the past there had been
slight fires there but they had been quickly extinguished,
though many said it would have been
as well to let the old structure burn down.</p>

<p>This time it seemed as if this would happen.
The factory was of wood, and there had been no
rain recently, so it was quite dry, and there was a
brisk wind to fan the flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s a goner,&rdquo; panted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks that way,&rdquo; agreed his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes the fire department,&rdquo; went on the
other, as they heard the clanging of a bell down
the road. A little later they could see, by the
glare of the fire, a crowd of village men and boys
dragging, by the long rope attached to it, a combined
chemical engine, and hook and ladder vehicle.
It was a new acquisition in the town of
Cedarhurst, and the citizens were very proud of
it, though they had no horses to pull it. But everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
who could do so grabbed hold of the long
rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re making good time,&rdquo; commented Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they might as well save themselves. The
old factory is better burned than standing. Guess
some more tramps went in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;d better be getting out by now,&rdquo;
observed the young pitcher, &ldquo;for it must be pretty
hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lads ran on, and soon found themselves
close to the burning structure. The heat of the
flames could be felt, and Tom and Joe moved
back into the crowd that had gathered. Up clattered
the fire apparatus, and there was the usual
excitement, with everyone giving orders, and telling
how it ought to be done.</p>

<p>Finally a chemical stream was turned on, the
whitish foaming mixture of bicarbonate of soda,
sulphuric acid and water spurting upon the flames.
There was a hiss, and the part of the fire that was
sprayed quickly died out.</p>

<p>But it was evident that several chemical streams
would be needed if the fire was to be completely
extinguished, whereas two lines of hose were all
that were available. In fact nothing but a smothering
deluge of water would have been effective,
and this was not obtainable.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never get that fire out!&rdquo; cried a man
in the crowd. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let it burn,
Chief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re here to put out fires. I&rsquo;m going
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what the chief was going to do he never
said, for at that moment, above the crackling of
the fire and the shouts of the men and boys, there
arose an agonized shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Save me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All eyes turned instinctively upward, and there,
perched on the ledge of what had once been the
clock tower of the factory, high above the roaring,
crackling flames, stood a man, wildly waving his
arms and crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Save me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! A man! He&rsquo;ll be burned to death!&rdquo;
yelled a score of persons as they saw the danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about right, unless he gets down pretty
soon,&rdquo; shouted Tom into Joe&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t
he go down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably because the stairs are burned away,&rdquo;
was Joe&rsquo;s shouted answer&mdash;everyone was shouting,
partly to make themselves heard and partly
because of the excitement, which was contagious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; cried the man again. He gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
one look below him and crowded closer to the
outer edge of the tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out! Don&rsquo;t jump!&rdquo; someone cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll save you!&rdquo; shouted the chief. &ldquo;Get
the ladder, boys! Lively now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scores of willing ones raced to the wagon and
began pulling out the ladders. They were the extension
kind, and could be made quite long. Several
men ran with one toward the building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that side! The flames are too hot! You
can&rsquo;t raise it there!&rdquo; cried the chief. &ldquo;Try
around back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men obeyed but a moment later there came
a disappointing shout:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too short! The ladder&rsquo;s too short! Get a
longer one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the longest we&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; answered the
chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then splice two together!&rdquo; urged some one,
but the suggestion could hardly have been carried
out with safety. No one knew what to do. The
flames were mounting higher and higher, bursting
out on all sides now, so that in a few moments,
even had there been a ladder long enough to reach
to the man, it could not have been raised against
the building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; continued to call the seemingly-doomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
one. He moved still nearer to the edge
of the tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; yelled the crowd.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might just as well be killed by the fall as
burned to death,&rdquo; remarked one man grimly. &ldquo;In
fact I&rsquo;d prefer it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t someone do something?&rdquo; begged a
woman hysterically.</p>

<p>The man held out his hands appealingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we only had an airship, we could rescue
him!&rdquo; murmured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;I have an idea.
If I could only get a rope up to him he could slide
down it, if we held the outer end away from the
fire&mdash;a slanting cable you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; yelled his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you going to get a rope up to him?&rdquo;
asked Luke Fodick, who was standing beside our
hero. &ldquo;No one could throw a rope up there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, perhaps not a rope,&rdquo; admitted Joe, &ldquo;but
if I could throw a string we could tie the rope to
the string and he could haul it up and fasten it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t even throw a string up there,&rdquo;
insisted Luke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; added Hiram, who had
joined his crony. &ldquo;Nobody could.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes they can&mdash;I can!&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw
up this ball of cord. It will unwind on the way
up if I keep hold of one end of it,&rdquo; and he pulled
from his pocket a ball of light but strong cord.
Joe used it to wind around split bats. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to throw this,&rdquo; cried the young pitcher. &ldquo;Hey
there!&rdquo; he yelled to the man on the tower. &ldquo;Catch
this as it comes, and pull up the rope we&rsquo;re going
to fasten on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man waved his hands helplessly. He could
not hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going to get the rope?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off the fire apparatus, of course. It&rsquo;s long
and strong. Tom, you go get the rope off; I&rsquo;ve
got to make the man hear and understand before
I can throw the cord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff! The rope from the engine!&rdquo;
cried the man near Joe. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea, young
fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accompanied by Tom, the man raced to the
engine. He quickly explained what the plan of
rescue was, and others aided in taking from the
reel the long rope by which the apparatus was
pulled. Once more Joe shouted his instructions,
while the fire raged and crackled and the crowd
yelled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet! Quiet!&rdquo; begged Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
make him hear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make a megaphone&mdash;here&rsquo;s a newspaper,&rdquo;
suggested a man. He quickly rolled it into a cone,
tore off the small end to make a mouthpiece and
Joe had an improvised megaphone. Through it
he begged the crowd to keep silent, and at last
they heard and understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to throw you a ball of cord!&rdquo;
called Joe through the paper cone to the man on
the tower. &ldquo;Catch it, and when I yell again, pull
up the rope. Fasten it to the tower and we&rsquo;ll
hold the ground end out and away from the flames.
Then slide down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man waved his hands to show that he understood.
Then Joe got ready to throw up the
cord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do it! He&rsquo;ll never be able to get
that ball up to the man. It will fall short or go
into the flames,&rdquo; said Luke Fodick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; asked Tom, who came back,
helping to pull the long rope. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
how Joe Matson can throw. Just watch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, amid a silence that was painfully tense,
the young pitcher got ready to deliver a ball on
which more depended than on any other he had
ever thrown in all his life.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<h3>THE WARNING</h3>


<p>Joe hesitated a moment. Everything would
depend on his one throw, because there was no
chance to get another ball of cord, and if this one
went wide it would fall into the fire and be rendered
useless.</p>

<p>The fire was increasing, for all the chemicals in
the tank on the wagon had been used, and no fresh
supply was available. Below the tower on which
the man stood, the flames raged and crackled.
Even the tower itself was ablaze a little and at
times the smoke hid the man from view momentarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to wait until it clears,&rdquo; murmured the
young pitcher, when, just as he got ready to
throw, a swirl of vapor arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t wait much longer,&rdquo; said Tom, in an
ominously quiet voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; agreed Joe desperately, and it
was but too evident. The tower itself, weakened
by the fire, would soon collapse, and would carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the man down with it into the seething fire below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw! Throw!&rdquo; urged several in the throng.</p>

<p>Joe handed the loose end of the cord to Tom.
He wanted to give all his attention to throwing the
ball. He poised himself as if he was in the pitching
box. It was like a situation in a game when
his side needed to retire the other in order to win,
as when two men were out, three on bases and the
man at bat had two strikes and three balls. All
depended on one throw.</p>

<p>With a quick motion Joe drew back his arm.
There was an intaking of breath on the part of
the crowd that could be heard even above the
crackling of the flames. All eyes were centered on
the young pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never do it,&rdquo; murmured Hiram Shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he does he&rsquo;s a better pitcher than I&rsquo;ll ever
be,&rdquo; admitted Frank Brown.</p>

<p>Suddenly Joe threw. <a href="#image04">The white ball was plainly
visible as it sailed through the air</a>, unwinding as
it mounted upward. On and on it went, Joe, no
less than every one in the crowd, watching it with
eager eyes. And as for the man on the tower
he eagerly stretched out his hands to catch the
ball of cord, on which his life now depended.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<a name="image04" id="image04"><img src="images/image04.jpg" width="376" height="600" alt="THE WHITE BALL WAS PLAINLY VISIBLE AS IT SAILED THROUGH THE AIR." title="THE WHITE BALL WAS PLAINLY VISIBLE AS IT SAILED THROUGH THE AIR." /></a>
<br /><span class="caption"><a href="#Page_161">THE WHITE BALL WAS PLAINLY VISIBLE AS IT SAILED THROUGH THE AIR.</a></span>
</div>

<p>Straight and true it went, as swift and as direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a ball as Baseball Joe had ever delivered. Straight
and true&mdash;on and on and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Into the hands of the anxiously waiting man
went the ball of cord. Eagerly he clutched it,
while the crowd set up a great cheer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; yelled a man in Joe&rsquo;s ear.
&ldquo;You sure are one good pitcher, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that now,&rdquo; said the practical
Joe. &ldquo;Fasten on the rope. Quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willing hands did this, and Joe looked to see
if the knot would not slip. He seemed to have
assumed charge of the rescue operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haul up!&rdquo; he yelled to the man through the
newspaper megaphone. &ldquo;Haul up the rope and
make it fast. Then, when I give the signal, slide
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man waved his hands to show that he understood,
and the next moment he began pulling
on the cord. The rope followed. Quickly it uncoiled
from where the strands had been piled in
readiness for just this. Up and up the man on
the tower pulled it until he held the end of the
heavy rope in his hands.</p>

<p>There now extended from the tower to the
ground a slanting pathway of rope, such as is sometimes
seen leading down into a stone quarry. It
was high enough above the flames to enable a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
man to swing himself along above them, though
doubtless he would have to pass over a zone of
fierce heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready! Come on down!&rdquo; yelled Joe, and
the man on the tower lost no time in obeying.</p>

<p>He let go the rope as his feet touched the earth
and then with a groan he collapsed. The crowd
closed in around him, and two minutes later the
tower, with a crash, toppled into the midst of the
seething furnace of fire. The rescue had been
made none too soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crowd around him so!&rdquo; shouted Joe,
hurrying over to where the man lay.</p>

<p>He pushed his way into the throng, followed
by Tom, and the two lads actually forced the men
and boys away from the man, who had evidently
fainted. Joe whipped off his coat and made a pillow
for the sufferer&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>As he bent over him, the man&rsquo;s face was illuminated
by the glare from the burning factory,
and our hero started back in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isaac Benjamin!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he recognized
the former manager of the Royal Harvester
works where Mr. Matson had been employed.
Isaac Benjamin, the man who, with Mr. Rufus
Holdney, had conspired to ruin Joe&rsquo;s father by
getting his patents away from him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Isaac Benjamin!&rdquo; said Joe again.</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin opened his eyes. Into them
came the light of recognition as he gazed into
Joe&rsquo;s face. He struggled to a sitting position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe&mdash;Joe Matson!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
hope your father will forgive me. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t think of that now,&rdquo; said Joe
gently. &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;nothing of any consequence. I&rsquo;m not
even burned, thanks to you. I climbed up into the
tower when I found the place on fire. I&mdash;I&mdash;Joe,
can you ever forgive me for trying to ruin your
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. But don&rsquo;t talk of that now,&rdquo;
Joe said, while the crowd looked on and wondered
at the man and boy knowing each other&mdash;wondered
at their strange talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I must talk of that now&mdash;more&mdash;more
danger threatens your father, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe thought perhaps the man might be in a
delirium of fright, and he decided it would be best
to humor him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said soothingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be taken care of. We&rsquo;ve sent for a doctor. How
did you come to be in the old factory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was sleeping there, Joe.&rdquo; Mr. Benjamin&rsquo;s
tones did not indicate a raving mind.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleeping there?&rdquo; There was surprise in the
boy&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Joe, I&rsquo;m down and out. I&rsquo;ve lost all
my money, my friends have gone back on me&mdash;though
it&rsquo;s my own fault&mdash;I have lost my home&mdash;my
position&mdash;everything. I&rsquo;m an outcast&mdash;a
tramp&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I was sleeping there. There
were some other tramps. They were smoking&mdash;I
guess that&rsquo;s how the fire started. They got away
but I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s voice was excited now, and Joe
tried to calm him. But Mr. Benjamin continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, Joe, I have something to tell you&mdash;something
important&mdash;a warning to give you. If
we&mdash;can we talk in private?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, later, when you are stronger,&rdquo; answered
the lad soothingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it may be too late,&rdquo; went on Mr. Benjamin.
&ldquo;I am strong enough now. It was just a
passing faintness. I&mdash;I am weak&mdash;haven&rsquo;t had
much to eat&mdash;I&rsquo;m hungry. But no matter. Here,
come over here, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet with Joe&rsquo;s aid and led
the lad aside from the crowd, which parted to
make way for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m down and out, Joe. Money and friends
all gone.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Mr. Holdney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He too, has deserted me&mdash;turned against me,
though I helped him in many schemes. I&rsquo;m nothing
but a tramp now, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young pitcher looked at the wreck of the
man before him. Truly he was &ldquo;down and out.&rdquo;
His once fine and well-dressed appearance had
given place to a slouchy attire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must tell you, Joe. Your father&rsquo;s patent
rights are again in danger. Rufus Holdney is
going to try to get some valuable papers and
models away from him. That&rsquo;s what he and I
quarreled over. I&rsquo;d do anything to spoil his plans,
after he has thrown me off as he has. I left him,
and since then I have had only bad luck. I don&rsquo;t
know how I came to come here. I didn&rsquo;t know
you were here. But warn your father, Joe, to
look well after his new patents. Warn him before
it is too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; promised Joe. &ldquo;I will. Thank you
for telling me. Now we must look after you.&rdquo;
And indeed it was high time, for, as the young
pitcher spoke Mr. Benjamin tottered and would
have fallen had not our hero caught him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, get a doctor!&rdquo; cried Joe, as the crowd
surged up again around the unfortunate man, who
had fainted.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<h3>BAD NEWS</h3>


<p>Attention was divided, on the part of the
crowd, between the man who had been rescued,
and the fire. The old factory was now burning
fiercely and it was useless to try to save the structure.
In fact, nearly everyone was glad that it
had been destroyed, for it would harbor no more
tramps. So the man who had been so thrillingly
rescued was the greater attraction.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was a doctor in the throng,
and he gave Mr. Benjamin some stimulants which
quickly brought him out of his faint. Then a
carriage was secured, and the man was taken to
the village hotel, Joe agreeing to be responsible
for his board. Though Mr. Benjamin had
treated Mr. Matson most unjustly, and had tried
to ruin him, yet the son thought he could do no
less than to give him some aid, especially after
the warning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s all over but the shouting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
as they say at the baseball games,&rdquo; remarked Tom
to Joe. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get home. I&rsquo;m cold,&rdquo; for they had
both been drenched over the upper part of their
bodies by the initiation, and the night wind was
cold, in spite of the fact that Spring was well advanced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; admitted Joe, as he watched the
carriage containing Mr. Benjamin drive off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like some good hot lemonade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fire now held little attraction for our
friends and they hastened back to the dormitory,
Joe explaining on the way how he had unexpectedly
rescued a former enemy of his father&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t you going to send some word
home about that warning he gave you?&rdquo; asked
Tom, as Joe finished. &ldquo;That Holdney scoundrel
may be working his scheme now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sure. I&rsquo;m going to write to dad as
soon as we get back to our room. Sure I&rsquo;m going
to warn him. I&rsquo;m mighty sorry for Mr. Benjamin.
He&rsquo;s a smart man, but he went wrong, and
now he&rsquo;s down and out, as he says. But he did me
a good service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t even things up!&rdquo; spoke Teeter.
&ldquo;He surely would have been a gone one but for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, some one else might have thought of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
way of getting him down if I hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Joe
modestly. &ldquo;I remember a story I read in one of
the books I had when I was a kid. A fellow was
on a high chimney, and a rope he had used to
haul himself up slipped down. A big crowd
gathered and no one knew how to help him. His
wife came to bring his dinner and she got onto
a scheme right away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hey, John!&rsquo; she called &lsquo;unravel your sock.
Begin at the toe!&rsquo; You see he had on knitted socks.
Well, he unravelled one, got a nice long piece of
yarn and lowered it to the ground. He tied on
his knife, or something for a weight. Then they
fastened a cord to the yarn, and a rope to the
cord, he pulled the rope up and got down off the
chimney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your process, only reversed,&rdquo; commented
Tom. &ldquo;I say fellows,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s run and
get warmed up. I&rsquo;m shivering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was warm enough back there at the fire,&rdquo;
said Teeter, as he looked to where the blaze was
now dying out for lack of material on which to
feed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beastly mean of Hiram and Luke,&rdquo; commented
Peaches. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting scared I guess. I
hope we get &rsquo;em out of the nine before the season&rsquo;s
over.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe and Tom entertained their friends with
crackers and hot lemonade, and none of the professors
or monitors annoyed them with attentions.
They must have known of it, when Peaches went
to get the hot water in the dormitory kitchen, but
it is something to have a hero in a school, and Joe
was certainly the hero of the night.</p>

<p>The two lads, who had been thoroughly soaked,
stripped and took a good rub down, and this, with
the hot lemonade, set them into a warm glow.
Then they sat about and talked and talked until
nearly midnight.</p>

<p>Joe wrote a long letter to his father explaining
all the circumstances and warned him to be on the
lookout. One of the janitors who had to arise
early to attend to his duties promised to see that
the missive got off on the first morning mail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, now, I guess we&rsquo;ll go to bed,&rdquo; announced
Joe.</p>

<p>There was much subdued excitement in chapel
the next morning, and Dr. Fillmore made a reference
to the events of the night before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very proud of the way you young gentlemen
behaved at the fire,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was an
exciting occasion, and yet you held yourselves well
within bounds. We have reason to be very proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of one of our number who distinguished himself,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Joe Matson!&rdquo; yelled
Peaches, and they were given heartily&mdash;something
that had never before happened in chapel. Dr.
Fillmore looked surprised, and Professor Rodd
was evidently pained, but Dr. Rudden was observed
to join in the ovation, over which Joe
blushed painfully.</p>

<p>Joe caught a cold from his wetting and exposure.
It was nothing serious, but the school physician
thought he had better stay in bed for a
couple of days, and, much against his will the
young pitcher did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is baseball practice going on?&rdquo; he asked
Tom after the first day. &ldquo;I wish I could get out
and watch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s going pretty good. We scrubs have
a hard job holding the school nine down when
you&rsquo;re not there to pitch. There&rsquo;s a game with
Woodside Hall to-morrow, and I guess we&rsquo;ll
win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Excelsior Hall did win that contest, but not by
as big a score as they should have done. It was
the old story of Hiram and Luke not managing
things right, and having weak pitchers. Still it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
was a victory, and served to elate the bully and
his crony.</p>

<p>It was on the third day of Joe&rsquo;s imprisonment
in his room, and his cold was much better. He
had heard that Mr. Benjamin had recovered and
left the hotel; no one knew for what place.</p>

<p>He sent Joe a note of thanks, however, and it
came in with some mail from home. Joe opened
the home letters first. There was one from his
father, enclosed in one from his mother and
Clara.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Dear Joe,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Matson. &ldquo;I got your
warning, but it was too late. Why didn&rsquo;t you
telegraph me? The night before your letter got
here some valuable papers and models were stolen
from my new shop. I have no doubt but that
Holdney did it&mdash;he or some of his tools. It will
cripple me badly, but I may be able to pull
through. I appreciate what Benjamin did for
us, and it was mighty smart of you to save him
that way. But why didn&rsquo;t you telegraph me about
the danger to my models?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe bitterly to himself.
&ldquo;What a chump I was. Why didn&rsquo;t I
telegraph dad, and then it would have been in
time. Why didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<h3>BITTER DEFEAT</h3>


<p>Joe&rsquo;s first act, after receiving the bad news
from home, was to sit down and write his father
a letter full of vain regrets, of self-accusation, upbraiding
himself for having been so stupid as not
to have thought of telegraphing. He hastened
to post this, going out himself though barely over
his cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take any more chances,&rdquo; he
remarked to Tom. &ldquo;Maybe that other letter
wasn&rsquo;t mailed by the janitor, or it would have
gotten to dad in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; remarked his chum. &ldquo;Your father
says the things were taken the night before your
letter arrived, so you would have had to write
the day before to have done any good. Only a
telegram would have been of any use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; admitted Joe sorrowfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a chump!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry any more,&rdquo; advised his
friend. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get at some baseball practice.
The school has two games this week.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who with?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woodside Hall and the Lakeview Preps. We
ought to win &rsquo;em both. They need you back on
the scrub. The first nine has had it too easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be glad to get back,&rdquo; replied the
young pitcher earnestly. &ldquo;It seems as if I hadn&rsquo;t
had a ball in my hands for a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe mailed his letter and then, as the day was
just right to go out on the diamond, he and Tom
hastened there, finding plenty of lads awaiting
them. A five-inning game between the scrub and
school teams was soon arranged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now boys, go in and clean &rsquo;em up!&rdquo; exclaimed
Luke, as his men went to bat, allowing
the scrub the advantage of being last up. This
was done to make the first team strive exceptionally
hard to pile up runs early in the practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t any of you fan out,&rdquo; warned Hiram.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m watching you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; added Dr. Rudden, the coach,
as he strolled up. &ldquo;You first team lads want to
look to your laurels. You have plenty of games
to play before the finals to decide the possession
of the Blue Banner, but remember that every
league game counts. Your percentage is rather
low for the start of the season.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>He was putting it mildly. The percentage of
Excelsior Hall was exceedingly low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beat the scrub!&rdquo; advised the coach-teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do it with Joe in the box!&rdquo; declared
Tom; and Luke and Hiram sneered audibly.
Their feeling against our two heroes had not
improved since the event of the initiation.</p>

<p>The scrub nine was not noted for its heavy
hitting, but in this practice game they outdid
themselves, and when they came up for their first
attempt they pulled down the lead of four runs
which the school nine had, to one. There was
an ominous look on the faces of Luke and Hiram
as the first team went to bat for the second time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make &rsquo;em look like a plugged nickel,&rdquo; advised
Tom to his pitching chum. &ldquo;The worse
you make &rsquo;em take a beating the more it will show
against Hiram and Luke. We want to get &rsquo;em
out of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Joe, and then he &ldquo;tightened
up,&rdquo; in his pitching, with the result that a
goose egg went up in the second frame of the first
team.</p>

<p>Even Dr. Rudden looked grave over this. If
the school nine could not put up a better game
against their own scrub, all of whose tricks and
mannerisms they knew, what could they do against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the two regular nines with whom they were to
cross bats during the week? When the scrubs got
another run, Joe knocking a three bagger, and
coming home on Tommy Barton&rsquo;s sacrifice, there
was even a graver look on the face of the coach.
As for Luke and Hiram, they held a consultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make a shift somewhere,&rdquo; declared
Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just let Akers go in the box in place of
Frank Brown,&rdquo; decided the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not enough,&rdquo; insisted the manager.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how to play your own men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know as much as you do about it!&rdquo; fired
back Luke. Of late the bully and his crony
had not agreed overwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; reaffirmed Hiram. &ldquo;I tell
you what you ought to do. You ought to get rid
of Peaches, Teeter and George Bland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re three of the best players on the
nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not, and besides they&rsquo;re too
friendly with Joe Matson and Sister Davis. They
don&rsquo;t half play. They make errors on purpose,
just to make the school team have a bad reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should they do that?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, you chump? They
want to force you and me out. That&rsquo;s their game.
They&rsquo;re sore about that meeting, and Matson and
Davis are sore about lots of things. Peaches and
the other two think if they get us out there&rsquo;ll be
a chance for Joe to pitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s their game, is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Luke.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll put a stop to it. I&rsquo;ll make subs of
Peaches, Bland and Teeter, and put in some other
players. They can&rsquo;t come it over me that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire, for the talk
between the captain and manager was delaying
the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll play all right,&rdquo; snapped Luke, and
he knew that he and his nine had to, for the score
was now tie. &ldquo;Peaches, Teeter, Bland, you can
sit on the bench a while!&rdquo; went on Luke. &ldquo;Wilson,
Natch and Gonzales, you&rsquo;ll take their places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; asked the innocent and
unoffending Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have we played so rotten?&rdquo; Teeter wanted
to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made the changes because I wanted to,&rdquo;
snapped Luke. &ldquo;Go sit down with the other
subs, and we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t play a decent
game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps Peaches and his chums may have understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the reason for Luke&rsquo;s act, but if they
did, they did not say so. The game went on with
the three new players, and the result may be imagined.
The scrub continued to get ahead, and
the school nine could not catch up because Joe
was pitching in great form, and striking out man
after man, though he was hit occasionally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is worse than ever,&rdquo; growled Hiram,
when another inning passed and the scrub was
five runs ahead. &ldquo;Change back again, Luke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, they&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it. We&rsquo;ll be worse than crazy if
we don&rsquo;t win this little measly game. And think
what will happen Friday and Saturday. Change
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Peaches, Teeter and George were called
from the bench again, and they played desperately.
There was a general tightening all along
the line, and the school nine began to see victory
ahead. Joe got a little wild occasionally, principally
because he was out of practice, but the best
the school nine could do was to tie the score in
the fifth inning, and it had to go to seven before
they could win, though they had planned to play
only five. The school nine won by a margin of
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too close for comfort, boys,&rdquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
coach. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you have a little mercy,
Joe?&rdquo; he asked of the young scrub pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will next time&mdash;maybe,&rdquo; was the laughing
answer. Luke and Hiram scowled at him as
they passed. They would have witnessed with
pleasure his withdrawal from the school. But
Joe was going to stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Luke of
Hiram as they walked on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nine. We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to win these two
games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to do some more shifting, I
guess, and Brown and Akers have got to tighten
up on their pitching. We&rsquo;ll try some more shifting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you make me sick!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain.
&ldquo;Always changing. What good does that
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m manager of this nine!&rdquo; declared the
bully, &ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t like the way I run things,
you know what you can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luke subsided after that. He was afraid of
Hiram, and he wanted to remain as captain. The
two discussed various plans, but could come to
no decision.</p>

<p>The inevitable happened. In the game with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Woodside the Excelsiors managed to get a few
runs in the early innings, but their opponents did
likewise, because the Hall pitcher could not hold
the batters in check. Then Woodside sent in another
pitcher, better than the first, and the Excelsiors
got only a few scattering hits, while, after
shifting from Brown to Akers, Luke&rsquo;s nine did
even worse, for Akers was pounded out of the
box. The score was fifteen to six in favor of
Woodside when the final inning ended, and the
Excelsiors filed off the diamond in gloomy mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it couldn&rsquo;t have been much worse,&rdquo;
growled Luke to the manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was pretty bad,&rdquo; admitted Hiram, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll whitewash the Preps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Excelsior Hall nine journeyed to the Lakeview
school full of hope, for the lads there did
not have a very good reputation as hitters, and
their pitcher was not out of the ordinary. But
it was the same old story&mdash;mismanagement, and
a captain of the Excelsiors who didn&rsquo;t dare speak
his own mind.</p>

<p>If Luke had been allowed to run the team to
suit himself he might have been able to do something
with it, but Hiram insisted on having his
way.</p>

<p>The result can be imagined. Instead of beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the Lakeview boys by a large score, as they
had done the previous year, Excelsior was beaten,
nine to seven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not as bad as the last game,&rdquo; was
all the consolation Hiram could find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t talk to me!&rdquo; snapped Luke.
&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got to be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; put in Peaches, who came up
just then. &ldquo;Something has got to be done, Hiram
Shell, and right away, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked the bully squarely in the face. Behind
Peaches came Teeter, George Bland and
several of the subs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; stammered
Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that it&rsquo;s either you or us,&rdquo; went on
Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either you get out as manager or we get out
as players,&rdquo; added Teeter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tired of playing
on a nine that can&rsquo;t win a game. We can
play ball, and we know it. But not with you,
Hiram. What&rsquo;s it going to be&mdash;you or us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; burst out the bully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you
know that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hand was placed on his shoulder. He wheeled
about to confront Dr. Rudden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think something <i>must</i> be done,&rdquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
coach quietly. &ldquo;Call a meeting of the Athletic
Committee, Shell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked the bully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To discuss the situation. There has got to
be a change if Excelsior Hall is to have a chance
for the Blue Banner. If you don&rsquo;t call the meeting,
Shell, I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was perhaps the best thing that could have
happened, and to save friction among the students,
many of whom were still for the manager,
Hiram knew he had to give in to Dr. Rudden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;The meeting will
take place to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quickly the word went around through the
precincts of Excelsior Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be another hot meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hiram&rsquo;s on his last legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His game is up now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This means that Joe Matson will pitch, sure,
and we&rsquo;ll win some games now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Hiram goes, Luke will, too, and there&rsquo;ll
be a new captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were only a few of the comments and
predictions made by the players and other students
as they got ready to attend the session.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<h3>HIRAM IS OUT</h3>


<p>There was an ominous silence over the
gathering in the gymnasium. It was entirely different
from the former meeting which started in
such a hub-bub, and which created such a stir.
This time it meant &ldquo;business,&rdquo; as Peaches said.</p>

<p>Hiram called the session, but refused to preside.
He wanted to be able to say what he thought
from the floor, and from the manner in which he
and Luke and one or two of their friends conferred
before the session opened, it was evident
that Hiram was going to make a fight to maintain
his prestige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to order, young gentlemen,&rdquo; suggested
Dr. Rudden, when the gymnasium was well filled.
It seemed as if every lad in Excelsior Hall was
there. &ldquo;You know what we are here for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To elect a new manager and captain!&rdquo;
shouted someone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; commanded the coach, banging his
gavel.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; cried Hiram, springing to
his feet. &ldquo;If I find out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; commanded the chairman, while
Luke pulled his crony to his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This meeting will be conducted in a gentlemanly
manner, or not at all,&rdquo; went on the professor
quietly; but the boys knew what he meant.
&ldquo;We are here to discuss the baseball situation,
and try to decide on some plan for bettering the
team. I will hear suggestions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just want to say one thing,&rdquo; began Hiram.
&ldquo;I have managed this team for three seasons,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mis-managed it,&rdquo; murmured someone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we get the Blue Banner?&rdquo; asked
another voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen, you will have to keep from
making side remarks, and interrupting the speakers,&rdquo;
said Dr. Rudden. &ldquo;Go on, Shell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had any kicking on my management
before,&rdquo; continued Hiram, glaring at those around
him. &ldquo;I can manage it all right now, and it&rsquo;s
only some soreheads&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather unparliamentary language,&rdquo; the chairman
warned him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we had a few good players we could win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
every game,&rdquo; went on the bully. &ldquo;But the season
is young yet, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that is a valid excuse,&rdquo; said the
professor. &ldquo;You had your choice of the whole
school in picking the nine, so it is the fault of
yourself and the captain if you haven&rsquo;t a good
team. As for the earliness of the season, the
boys have had plenty of practice and they ought
to have struck their gait before this. I&rsquo;m afraid
something else is to blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need better pitchers for one thing!&rdquo;
called someone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; yelled a double score of voices,
and Dr. Rudden, seeing the sway of sentiment,
did not object.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got two good pitchers!&rdquo; fairly yelled
Hiram. &ldquo;I know what this all means&mdash;that Joe
Matson and his crowd&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; the chairman warned him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank Brown, jumping
to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a good pitcher, and I don&rsquo;t
mind admitting it. I can&rsquo;t hold the other fellows
down enough. If I could, we would have won
these last two games, for our boys can bat when
they haven&rsquo;t the heart taken out of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; cried Tom Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like being honest about it,&rdquo; commented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Dr. Rudden. &ldquo;That statement does you
credit, Brown. How many of you think the same&mdash;that
a different pitcher would strengthen the
team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I! I! I!&rdquo; yelled scores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so! Our pitchers are good enough!&rdquo;
These cries came from Luke, Hiram and a few
of their cronies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There seems to be a division of opinion,&rdquo;
began the chairman. &ldquo;I think we had better
vote on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of fellows here who have no
right to vote!&rdquo; cried Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, Shell,&rdquo; said Dr. Rudden sternly.
&ldquo;This is a matter that concerns the entire
school&mdash;to have a winning nine. Every student
is entitled to vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; yelled Tom. &ldquo;This is a victory
all right. The end of Hiram, Luke and Company
has come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pitch on the school team, Joe!&rdquo; called
Peaches in our hero&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; Joe answered back, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All in favor of having a change in pitchers,
since Frank Brown has been good enough, and
manly enough, to say that he knows his own weakness&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in favor of a change vote &lsquo;aye,&rsquo;&rdquo; directed
the chairman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; came in a thunderous chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Contrary minded&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; snapped Hiram. Luke and Jake Weston
followed with feeble negatives. They, too,
were beginning to see which way the wind blew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom will you have for pitcher?&rdquo; asked the
Professor. &ldquo;Can you decide now, or will you
wait and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decide now!&rdquo; was yelled. &ldquo;Joe Matson for
pitcher! Baseball Joe. Joe Matson!&rdquo; was cried
in different parts of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; assented the chairman. &ldquo;This
may be a wise move. All in favor of Joe Matson
as pitcher, since Frank Brown, the regular boxman,
has practically resigned&mdash;all say &lsquo;aye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again came the hearty assent, and again the
feeble objection of Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Matson is now the regular pitcher for the
school nine,&rdquo; said Dr. Rudden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I want to say that I&rsquo;m glad of the
change,&rdquo; put in Larry Akers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray! Hurray!&rdquo; yelled the now excited
and enthusiastic students. Things seemed to be
coming out right after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to say,&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, &ldquo;that while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
I appreciate the honor done me, we may need
substitute pitchers. In fact, I&rsquo;m sure we will, and
I wish Frank and Larry would remain to help me.
I&rsquo;ll coach them all I can, and I know they both
have pitching stuff in them. I&rsquo;ve made quite a
study of pitching as an amateur. Some day I hope
to be a professional, and I&rsquo;m willing to tell Frank
and Larry all I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the chairman. &ldquo;I think
they&rsquo;ll take your offer. Well, we have now made
one change. Are there any more that you think
necessary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rather a delicate question, for everyone
knew what was meant. But the lads were saved
from doing what most of them knew ought to
be done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I understand that Joe Matson is the regular
pitcher on the school team?&rdquo; asked the manager,
sourly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems to be the sentiment of the students,
Shell,&rdquo; answered Dr. Rudden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And without me, or the captain, having anything
to say about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were out-voted, Shell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then all I&rsquo;ve got to say is that I don&rsquo;t
manage this nine any more!&rdquo; fairly yelled Hiram.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my resignation, and it takes effect at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
once!&rdquo; and, walking down the aisle he threw a
folded paper on the table at which the professor
sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall this resignation be accepted?&rdquo; asked the
chairman, amid a rather tense silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; came so quickly and with such volume
that there was no doubt about the sentiment of
the crowd. Perhaps Hiram had hoped that he
would be asked to reconsider it, but if so he was
disappointed. He walked back to where Luke
sat. He leaned over the captain and said something
in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to,&rdquo; replied Luke, loudly enough
for all in the room to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; ordered the bully. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then his voice sank to a whisper
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Luke, and walking forward
as his crony had done, he, too, tossed a
paper on the table. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my resignation as
captain and a member of the Excelsior baseball
nine!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>There was a gasp of surprise from the crowd.
Hiram and Luke both out! It was rather unexpected,
but Tom and his friends felt elated.
Now they would have a chance to play. It looked
like the dawn of a brighter day for Excelsior Hall.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

<h3>TWO OF A KIND</h3>


<p>&ldquo;There is another resignation to act on,&rdquo; said
Dr. Rudden, after a pause, and, somehow he did
not seem half as worried over it as Luke had
hoped he would be. &ldquo;What shall we do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, and it was accepted
with a promptness that startled the former
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The action taken to-night makes it necessary
to elect a new manager and a captain,&rdquo; went on
the professor. &ldquo;Perhaps the manager should be
elected first. Whom will you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peaches Lantfeld,&rdquo; called some.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teeter Nelson,&rdquo; said others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Bland! Sister Davis! Ward Gerard!
Tommy Barton,&rdquo; called various lads. There were
more nominations, but Peaches received the majority
of votes, and was declared elected. Teeter
was the first to congratulate him, and the others
followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now a captain,&rdquo; suggested the chairman.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Matson!&rdquo; yelled scores of voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t accept,&rdquo; cried Joe, jumping to his
feet. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to pitch I want to give all
my time to that. I&rsquo;m much obliged, but I decline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would not be wise to make your
pitcher the captain, especially at this time,&rdquo; spoke
Dr. Rudden. &ldquo;The catcher is in a better position
to captain a team, for he can see all the plays.
You will have to have a new catcher, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ward Gerard!&rdquo; called Joe. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s caught
for me on the scrub, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ward! Ward Gerard!&rdquo; Scores of lads took
up the calling of his name. He was very popular,
and was elected in a minute, while Hiram and
Luke, followed by Jake Weston, filed from the
room in plainly-shown disgust, sneers on their
faces.</p>

<p>Nothing more remained to do save to have a
conference of the new captain and manager, to
arrange for future practice and playing. This
was soon done, and Ward told the lads to report
early the next Monday afternoon, when they
would play the scrub, which organization had also
to select a new captain and pitcher, as well as
catcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, all I want is to get Tom Davis on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
school nine, and I&rsquo;ll be happy,&rdquo; said Joe to Peaches
and Teeter, as the meeting broke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you can,&rdquo; declared Teeter. &ldquo;Jake
Weston is going to get out, I hear, and Tom will
fit in. Charlie Borden can take Jake&rsquo;s place at
short and Tom can play first, which he&rsquo;s used
to. Oh, I guess old Excelsior Hall has come into
her own again, and we&rsquo;ll make some of these other
teams sit up and take notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Jake did resign, following the example of
his two cronies. This made a place for Tom, and
he promptly filled it.</p>

<p>There was a snap and a vim to the playing of
the school nine when they first went at it with the
changed players, that fairly took the breath out
of the scrub. Of course that unfortunate collection
of players was weakened by the withdrawal
of Joe, Ward and Tom, but even with players of
equal strength it is doubtful if they could have
held the school nine down.</p>

<p>Joe and his mates struck a winning streak, and
the young pitcher never was better than in that
practice game on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s pitching his head off,&rdquo; observed Tom
Davis, and when Ward missed holding one or two
particular &ldquo;hot&rdquo; ones he thought the same thing.
The school team won a decisive victory.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we will beat Trinity
on Saturday,&rdquo; said Peaches, the new manager.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin to take it easy, fellows. And then
follows the second game in the series with Morningside.
We&rsquo;ve got to get that or those boys will
think they&rsquo;ve gotten into the habit of beating us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll trim &rsquo;em both!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented Joe. It was like old times
now, he reflected, he and Tom together on a team
as they had been on the Silver Stars. The only
thing that worried Joe was the theft of his father&rsquo;s
papers and patent models. He knew it would
mean a serious loss to his parents, and Joe was
rather in fear that he might have to leave boarding
school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I have to go away, I hope it won&rsquo;t be
until after I have helped win back the Blue Banner,&rdquo;
he confided to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; advised his chum; and a
few days later Joe received a letter from home,
telling him the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson wrote that whereas the loss would
badly cripple him, yet he did not want Joe to
worry.</p>

<p>The game with Trinity was a source of delight
to the Excelsior team. Their rivals came to the
diamond battlefield eager for a victory, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
worked hard for it, but the new combination was
too much for them. When the final run was
chalked up the score stood:</p>

<p>Excelsior Hall, 11; Trinity, 4.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want to do to Morningside,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we will!&rdquo; predicted Joe.</p>

<p>They had hard practice before the second game
with their ancient rivals&mdash;for Morningside was a
foe whom Excelsior Hall was always eager to
beat. In the series for the possession of the Blue
Banner she had three games with Morningside
and a like number with the other teams in the
league.</p>

<p>It was the day of the second Morningside game,
and it was to take place on the Excelsior diamond.
The weather could not have been better. Spring
was just merging into Summer, and the lads were
on their mettle. There had been a big improvement
in their playing, and they were ready to do
battle to a finish.</p>

<p>Luke and Hiram had not been much in evidence
since their resignations. They occasionally came
to a game, or to practice, but they made sneering
remarks, and few of the students had anything
to do with them. It was quite a jolt for Hiram,
used as he was to running matters to suit himself.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd began arriving early at the Excelsior
diamond, for word had gone around that it
was to be a game for &ldquo;blood,&rdquo; and both teams
were on edge. If Excelsior had improved, so had
Morningside. They had strengthened their men
by long, hard practice, and they were confident of
victory.</p>

<p>Joe and Tom had expected before this to hear
something about their old enemy, Sam Morton, at
Morningside, but the former pitcher for the Silver
Stars was seldom mentioned. However, it was
learned that he was to substitute in the Morningside-Excelsior
game.</p>

<p>Out on the diamond trotted the renovated Excelsior
nine. They were received with a burst of
applause, and at once got to practice. A little
later out came their rivals, and there was a cheer
for them. Immediately the opposition cheering
and shouting contingents got busy, and there was
a riot of sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to stay and see the game?&rdquo; asked Luke
of Hiram, as they entered the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, might as well. Gee! But I hope our
fellows lose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nice sentiments, weren&rsquo;t they for an Excelsior
student? But then Hiram was very sore and
angry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Luke. &ldquo;It would show them
what a mistake they made by dropping us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed the conceited Hiram.
&ldquo;If they had only waited we&rsquo;d have come out all
right. It was all the fault of Joe Matson and
Tom Davis. I&rsquo;ll get square with &rsquo;em yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They strolled over the grounds, winding in and
out amid the throngs. They almost collided with
a Morningside player.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon,&rdquo; murmured Luke. &ldquo;Oh,
it&rsquo;s Sam Morton,&rdquo; he added, for he had met Sam
in town a week or so previously. &ldquo;Have you
met Hiram Shell, Sam,&rdquo; and he introduced the
two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you&rsquo;re the manager of the Excelsiors,&rdquo;
said Sam. &ldquo;Glad to know you. I think
we&rsquo;ll beat you again. I may pitch after the fifth
inning. I&rsquo;m only the sub now, but I expect to
be the regular soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>was</i> manager,&rdquo; replied Hiram bitterly, &ldquo;but
Joe Matson and his crowd put up a game on me,
and I resigned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe Matson, eh? He&rsquo;s the same fellow who
made a lot of trouble for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; murmured Luke. &ldquo;I see a
friend of mine. I&rsquo;m going to leave you for a
minute.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Hiram. &ldquo;So Joe Matson
made trouble for you, too, eh?&rdquo; he went on
to Sam, curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he played a mean trick on me, and took
my place as pitcher,&rdquo; which wasn&rsquo;t exactly true,
as my old readers know. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get square
with him some way,&rdquo; concluded Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, so would I!&rdquo; exclaimed Hiram eagerly.
&ldquo;Shake hands on that. He&rsquo;s a low sneak, and
he played a mean trick on me. I&rsquo;d do anything
to get even.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can,&rdquo; suggested Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, lots of ways. Come on over here where
no one will hear us. Maybe we can fix up some
scheme on him. I&rsquo;d give a good deal to get even.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; added Hiram. &ldquo;I wish I could
get him off the nine, and out of the school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; proposed Sam eagerly; and
then the two, who were very much of a kind when
it came to disliking our hero, walked off, whispering
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; came the distant cry of the umpire,
and the great Excelsior-Morningside game
was about to start. But the plotters did not turn
back to watch it.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h3>BY A CLOSE MARGIN</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Captain Elmer Dalton of
the Morningside nine, as he greeted some of the
lads against whom his team was to play, &ldquo;you
fellows have been making a lot of changes, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; and he looked at the several new members
of the school team, including Joe and Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a bit of house cleaning,&rdquo; replied Ward
Gerard. &ldquo;I am captain now. Hiram and Luke
got out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard there was some sort of a row.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose it&rsquo;s all over the league by this
time,&rdquo; put in Peaches. &ldquo;But it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.
It was like a dose of bitter medicine, but we took
it, and I think it&rsquo;s going to do us good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean <i>we&rsquo;re</i> going to do you good,&rdquo;
laughed Elmer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to trim you again
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; cried Ward. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win. Come
now, a little wager between you and me&mdash;for the
sodas, say.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on!&rdquo; agreed Elmer. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your
batting list?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two captains walked over to the scoring
bench to arrange the details of the game. The
two teams were made up as follows, this being the
batting order:</p>

<p>The Excelsiors were to bat last, and while the
rival crowds of school boys were singing, cheering
and giving their class yells, Joe Matson walked
to the box for the second time as pitcher on the
school nine in a big school league game. No
wonder he felt a trifle nervous, but he did not
show it, not even when some one yelled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the new pitcher they&rsquo;ve got! We&rsquo;ll
get his number all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll have his goat in about a minute!&rdquo;
added another Morningside partizan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go as far as you like,&rdquo; answered Joe with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; yelled the umpire, and Joe faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the first batter, Dunlap Spurr, who had the reputation
of being a heavy hitter. Ward signalled
for a low one, for he knew that Dunlap had a
tendency to hit over such a ball. Joe nodded his
head to show that he understood, and <a href="#image01">the next
moment the horsehide went speeding toward the
plate</a>.</p>

<p>The batter swung viciously at it but&mdash;missed.
He had gone half a foot over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; cried the umpire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him give you a pretty one!&rdquo; called Elmer.
&ldquo;He will if you wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t have long to wait,&rdquo; retorted our
hero. This time he decided to send one over the
corner of the plate, as he noticed that Dunlap had
a free swing. Joe hoped he would strike at it
and miss, and that was exactly what happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo; howled the umpire, and there
followed a gasp of dismay. Dunlap was not
in the habit of doing this, and he rather scowled.
Joe smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more and we&rsquo;ll have him down!&rdquo; called
the catcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get the pitcher?&rdquo; asked a Morningside
wit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we had him made to order,&rdquo; replied Tom
Davis, who was anxiously waiting on first.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe hoped he could make it three straight
strikes, but his next was called a ball, and the
Morningside supporters let out a yell of gratification.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s his glass arm showing! He&rsquo;s going
to pieces!&rdquo; they yelled. Joe shut his jaw grimly.
He was going to fool the batter if possible, and
the next ball he sent in was a puzzling inshoot.</p>

<p>Instinctively Dunlap started away from the
plate, but he need not have moved, for the ball,
with a neat little twist, passed him at a safe distance,
and at a point where he could almost have
hit it had he tried. But he did not move his
bat, and an instant later the umpire called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three strikes&mdash;batter out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then indeed was there a gasp of dismay and
protest from the big crowd of Morningside sympathizers,
and the visiting nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; began Dunlap Spurr, &ldquo;that was
never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dry up!&rdquo; commanded his captain with
a laugh. &ldquo;It was a peach of a ball, and you ought
to have hit it. Don&rsquo;t begin that way. We can
beat &rsquo;em without that. Good work, Matson, but
you can&rsquo;t keep it up. Come on, Lee; you&rsquo;re up
next. Carlburg on deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe was immensely pleased, but he knew it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
only the beginning of the battle. He got two
strikes on Lee and that player began to get worried.
Then, after one ball, Lee hit the next one
for a pop fly that Joe hardly had to step out of
his box to get.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two down, play for all you&rsquo;re worth, Joe,&rdquo;
called Ward; but Joe needed no such urging.
However, something went wrong. Either Joe did
not have as good control, speed or curving ability
as when he had started in, or the next players
found him. At any rate Carlburg knocked a dandy
two bagger, and Ted Clay, who followed,
duplicated the trick. Carlburg came in with the
first run of the game, amid a riot of noise, and
when Wallace Douglass hit safely to first, Clay
got to third, coming in with the second run a little
later, when Captain Dalton also singled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em going! We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em going!&rdquo;
yelled the delighted Morningside crowd,
and it did seem so. Joe felt that he must tighten
up, and strike out the next man, or all would be
lost.</p>

<p>He glanced at the bench, where the jubilant
Morningside players were sitting, all regarding
him sharply. It was a supreme test. Then Joe
caught the eyes of some one else on him. The
eyes of Sam Morton, his old enemy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>It was like a dash of cold water. For the time
being he had forgotten that Sam was the substitute
pitcher on the visiting team, but had Joe seen
him and Hiram in close consultation a little while
previously, our hero would have had reason long
to remember it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em I am still in the ring!&rdquo; Joe murmured,
and when he wound up for his next delivery
he knew that he had himself well in hand
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on now, bring us all in!&rdquo; urged Captain
Dalton, when Walker Bromley got up to the plate.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll walk you, and then Loftus and Harry will
have a show. We&rsquo;ll have the whole team up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It began to look so, for already seven of the nine
had been at bat. Joe might have wasted time trying
to nail some lad who was playing too far off base,
but he did not. Instead he sized up Bromley and
sent him a swift one. The batter struck at it and
missed. The next ball was called a strike, and
attention was at fever heat. Would Walker hit
it?</p>

<p>The question was answered in the negative a
moment later, for he swung at it with all his force
and fanned the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo; called the umpire, and the side was
retired. But Morningside had two runs, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
way Joe had been hit by four men did not augur
well for Excelsior&rsquo;s chances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;em!&rdquo; said Ward, with more
confidence than he felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they pound Joe out of the box,&rdquo; murmured
Hiram to Luke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said the former catcher.</p>

<p>Excelsior hoped for great things when it came
her turn at stick-work, but alas for hopes! A
series of happenings worked against her. George
Bland rapped out as pretty a two bagger as one
could wish, but he tried to steal third, slipped on
a pebble when almost safe, and was thrown out.
Peaches Lantfeld knocked a sharp grounder that
looked almost certain to get past the shortstop;
and it did, but the third baseman, who was a rattling
good player, nabbed it and Peaches went
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Teeter!&rdquo; called Ward. &ldquo;See what you
can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Teeter got to first on a muffed fly, and it was
Nat Pierson&rsquo;s turn. Nat could usually be depended
on, but this time he could not. He fanned
twice and the third time got two fouls in succession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re finding the ball, anyhow,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Ward cheerfully. &ldquo;Kill it next time, Nat, and
give Sister Davis a show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nat tried to, but he knocked an easy fly, which
the pitcher gathered in, and the opportunity of the
Excelsior nine was over for that inning. A big
goose egg went up in their frame. Score: 2&mdash;0,
in favor of the visitors.</p>

<p>Joe took a long breath when he went into the
box again, and facing Loftus Brown, struck him
out in such short order that his friends began to
breathe easier again. The game was far from
lost, and as long as Joe did not allow his &ldquo;goat&rdquo;
to be gotten, Excelsior might win yet. Then Harry
Young, probably the poorest batter the visitors
had, fanned thrice successively, and it was Dunlap
Spurr&rsquo;s turn again. Joe knew just what to give
him, and when he struck him out, after two foul
strikes had been made, the crowd set up a yell.</p>

<p>The visitors did not get a run in their half of
the second, and once more Excelsior had a show.
Tom Davis singled, got around to third when
Charlie Borden knocked a two-bagger, and slid
home in a close play when Harry Lauter was
thrown out at first. There was only one gone
when Joe came to bat, and one run had come in.
Joe knocked a safety, or at least it looked as if it
was going to be that, but the shortstop, by a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
jump into the air, nabbed it, and then came
as pretty a double play as had ever taken place on
that diamond. Joe was put out and Charlie Borden,
who had been hugging third, was caught at
home, for he was not a fast runner.</p>

<p>That retired the side, and there was only one
run to match the two which Morningside had. Still
it was something, and the home team began to
take heart.</p>

<p>Then began what was one of the most remarkable
games in the series. Joe did not allow a hit
in the first half of the third inning and the Excelsiors
got one run, tying the score. In the fourth
the visitors pulled a single tally down, putting
them one ahead, and then, just to show what they
could do, the home team knocked out two, gaining
an advantage of one.</p>

<p>The crowd was wild with delight at the clean
playing, for both teams were on their mettle, and
the rival pitchers were delivering good balls. But
the fifth inning nearly proved a Waterloo for our
friends. The Morningsides got four runs, which
made Joe groan inwardly in anguish, for he was
severely pounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better let Brown or Akers go
in,&rdquo; he suggested to Ward.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;You
are all right. It was just a slip. Hold hard and
we&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe held hard, and there was a little encouragement
when his team got one run, making the
score at the ending of the fifth inning seven to five
in favor of the Morningside team.</p>

<p>Once more in the opening of the sixth Joe did
the trick. He allowed but one single, and then
three men fanned in succession, while, just to make
things more than ever interesting, the Excelsiors
got two runs, again tying the score.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;ll have to wake up if we&rsquo;re going to
wallop these fellows,&rdquo; confided the visiting captain
to his lads. &ldquo;They have certainly improved
a lot by getting Hiram and Luke out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;em,&rdquo; predicted Ted Clay, the
pitcher.</p>

<p>From then on the Excelsiors fairly &ldquo;played their
heads off,&rdquo; and they ought to have done much
better than they did when their hard work was
taken into consideration. But there were many
weak spots that might in the future be eliminated
by good coaching, and Joe needed harder practice.</p>

<p>But in every inning thereafter the home team
got at least one run, save only in the seventh. In
their half of the sixth they got two, as I have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and though the visitors got one in their half of
the seventh, again making the score one in their
favor, in the eighth our friends got three, while
the visitors got only two. So that at the close
of the eighth the score was: Excelsior, 10; Morningside
10.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tie! A tie!&rdquo; cried hundreds of voices. Indeed
it had pretty nearly been a tie game all the way
through, and it might go to ten innings or more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to beat &rsquo;em!&rdquo; declared Captain
Ward. &ldquo;Joe, whitewash &rsquo;em this inning, and in
the next we&rsquo;ll get the winning run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; confidently promised the young
pitcher, and he did. He was tossing the ball according
to his old form again, and not a man
landed his stick on it during the first half of the
ninth. Then, as the home team came up for
their last whacks (except in the event of the score
being a tie), they were wildly greeted by their
schoolmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One run to beat &rsquo;em! Only one!&rdquo; yelled the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s all up with us,&rdquo; remarked the visiting
captain to his men, as they took the field.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re bound to get that one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it!&rdquo; exclaimed the pitcher
fiercely.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>And it looked as if he was going to make good
his boast, for he struck out two men in quick order.
And then up came Tom Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swat it, Tom. Swat it!&rdquo; was the general
cry. &ldquo;Bring in a home run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch me,&rdquo; he answered grimly.</p>

<p>Two strikes were called on him, and two balls.
There was a nervous tension on everyone, for,
unless Tom made good, the game would have to
go another inning, when all sorts of possibilities
might happen.</p>

<p>Ping!</p>

<p>That was the mighty sound of Tom&rsquo;s bat landing
on the ball. Away sailed the horsehide&mdash;up
and away, far over the head of the centre fielder,
who raced madly after it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, you swatter, run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A homer! A homer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These cries greeted and encouraged Tom as he
legged it for first base. On and on he went,
faster and faster, rounding the initial bag, going
on to second and then to third. The centre fielder
had the ball now, but he would have to relay it in.
He threw as Tom left third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on! Come on!&rdquo; yelled Joe, jumping
up and down.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t bring in that run I&rsquo;ll never speak
to you again!&rdquo; shouted Ward.</p>

<p>The crowd was in a frenzy. Men and women
were standing up on the seats, some jumping up
and down, others yelling at the tops of their voices,
and some pounding each other on the back in
their excitement.</p>

<p>On and on ran Tom, but he was getting weary
now. The second baseman had the ball and was
swinging his arm back to hurl it home. But Tom
was almost there now, and he slid over the plate
a full two seconds ere the ball landed in the
catcher&rsquo;s big mitt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; howled the umpire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we win the game!&rdquo; yelled Joe, as he
raced over to Tom and slapped him on the back,
an example followed by so many others that poor
Tom nearly lost his breath. &ldquo;You won the game
for us, Tom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! If you hadn&rsquo;t held &rsquo;em down by
your pitching, Joe, my run wouldn&rsquo;t have done
any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried the others, and it was
so. Excelsior Hall had won the second of the
big games with her ancient rival, though it was
by the narrow margin of one run.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<h3>THE OVERTURNED STATUE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the Excelsiors!&rdquo; cried the
visiting captain, swinging his hat around in the air
as a signal to his crowd, after the excitement had
somewhat calmed. &ldquo;Three good cheers, boys!
They beat us fair and square! Three big cheers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And how they rang out! And how also rang
out the return cheers, which Joe and his mates
rendered. Never had applause sounded sweeter
in the ears of our hero, for it seemed that the
school nine had now begun to live in better days,
since the dismissal of Hiram and Luke.</p>

<p>Joe kept at his pitching practice, and he himself
knew, even had others, including Tom, not told
him, that he was doing well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re better than when you pitched for the
Silver Stars,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and you were no slouch
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I <i>am</i> more sure of myself,&rdquo; admitted
Joe. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got more speed and better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
curves.&rdquo; It was natural that he should have. He
was growing taller and stronger that Summer, and
he had most excellent practice. He had not given
up the idea of becoming a professional pitcher,
and everything he could do tended that way for
him.</p>

<p>He had heard nothing more definite from home,
but Mr. Matson said he was still trying to trace
the stolen models and papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you when vacation time comes,&rdquo; said
Joe in a letter. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m playing ball for all I&rsquo;m
worth now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep at it,&rdquo; his father wrote back.</p>

<p>There were many games played that season by
Excelsior Hall&mdash;many more than the previous
Summer&mdash;for Spring had now given place to warm
weather. The school term was drawing to a close,
but there were still many more games to play in
the league series.</p>

<p>In succession Excelsior met and defeated Trinity,
the Lakeview Preps. and Woodside Hall. She
was near the top of the list now, though Morningside
was quite a way in advance. It looked as if
eventually there would be a tie for first place between
the old rivals&mdash;a tie for the possession of
the Blue Banner, and if there was it meant a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
final game. Joe looked forward to it with mingled
fear and hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I hate him!&rdquo; exclaimed Hiram to his
crony, Luke, one day after a close game, when
Joe&rsquo;s pitching had won again for Excelsior. &ldquo;I
wish I could get him out of the school, or off the
nine, or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you? I thought you and Sam Morton
had some scheme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought so, too, but it fell through. But
I&rsquo;ve thought of something else, and if you and
Sam will help me carry it out, I think we can put
it all over that fresh guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll help; what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First we&rsquo;ve got to get hold of something belonging
to him&mdash;his knife, if it&rsquo;s got his name on;
a letter addressed to him, that he&rsquo;s opened and
read; a handkerchief with his name on; anything
that would show he&rsquo;d been in a certain place at a
certain time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the rest to Sam and me, if you can get
us something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; promised Luke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the same
corridor with Joe now; I changed my room, you
know. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what I could sneak
in and get something belonging to him.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it, then. I&rsquo;ve got a date with Sam, and
I&rsquo;ll go see him. See if you can get something this
afternoon or evening, and if you can we&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and the two plotters parted, the chief
one to keep an appointment with Joe&rsquo;s enemy.
Sam&rsquo;s hatred against our hero was increased because
Sam was not allowed to pitch for his own
team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to keep Ted Clay in condition, so that
when we meet Excelsior again he&rsquo;ll be on edge,&rdquo;
said Captain Dalton of the Morningsides. &ldquo;That
Matson is a wonder and we can&rsquo;t take any chances.
I don&rsquo;t dare risk letting you pitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another one I owe to Joe!&rdquo; muttered
Sam. &ldquo;I must certainly get even with him.
Hiram and I ought to pull off something,&rdquo; and
then he sent word to the Excelsior bully. That
afternoon the three conspirators, with guilty looks,
met in a secluded place and talked over their plans.</p>

<p>There was a knock on Joe&rsquo;s door. His chum
Tom had gone out that evening to a lecture, and
our hero was all alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; called Joe, and from down the corridor
Luke Fodick peered out of his slightly-opened
door to see what was going on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a telegram for you,&rdquo; said one of the
school messengers, handing in a yellow envelope.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A telegram for me,&rdquo; murmured Joe. &ldquo;It must
be from dad. I may have to send an answer.
Did the messenger wait?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, if I do have to wire, perhaps I
can get permission to go in to town to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quickly Joe tore open the message. It was
brief, and it was from his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understand Holdney is somewhere near
Cedarhurst,&rdquo; the message read. &ldquo;Keep a lookout,
and if you get trace notify police there at
once. Arrest on larceny charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rufus Holdney near here,&rdquo; murmured Joe.
&ldquo;I must keep my eyes open. I&rsquo;ll wire dad at once,
telling him I&rsquo;m on the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried from his room, stuffing the telegram
in his pocket as he went, and never noticing as he
passed Luke&rsquo;s door that it fell out into the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I can get permission to go to the telegraph
office,&rdquo; mused Joe as he hastened to the
office. &ldquo;I guess the doctor will let me when I
tell him what it&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Joe turned a corner out of sight, Luke
sprang out, picked up the message and envelope,
and exclaimed:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This will do the trick! Now to find Hiram
and Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried to tell his crony, who was being
visited by Sam, and once more the three put their
heads together, to work the ruin of our hero.</p>

<p>Joe easily obtained permission to go to town
to send his message. He was rather surprised on
looking in his pocket for his father&rsquo;s telegram,
not to find it, but concluded that he had left it in
his room. He did not really need it, anyhow, as
he knew the contents perfectly well.</p>

<p>The telegraph office was closed when he reached
it, but the operator lived near by, and agreed to
open his place, and tick off the message. This delayed
Joe, however, and he was rather late getting
back to the school. He did not see a teacher to
report to him, as he had been bidden to do, but
hurried to his own room.</p>

<p>He was tired and soon fell asleep, noting that
Tom was already in bed and slumbering. Joe did
not look for his lost message.</p>

<p>There was a thundering knock at Joe&rsquo;s door
the next morning. It awoke him and Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire! No. Haven&rsquo;t you heard the news?&rdquo;
asked the voice of Peaches. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big row
on.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; demanded Tom, slipping out of
bed, and opening the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Founder Statue has been pulled from its
base, and overturned!&rdquo; said Teeter, who was with
Peaches. &ldquo;Look, you can see it from your
window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Joe hastened to the casement to look.
On the campus, not far from the school, stood a
bronze statue of Dr. Theodore Whittleside, the
original founder of the institution. It was a fine
piece of work, the gift of several of the alumni
societies, and was almost sacred. Now some ruthless
hand had pulled it from its base, and part
of one of the hands was broken off.</p>

<p>For a moment Joe and Tom stood aghast, looking
at it. Then the meaning of it came to them.
Some sacrilegious student, or students, had done
the deed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a peach of a row over this!&rdquo;
declared Teeter. &ldquo;Hurry up and get to chapel.
Old Cæsar is sure to spout a lot about it. It&rsquo;s
sure dismissal for whoever did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it ought to be!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe wrathfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they catch them,&rdquo; added Tom, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I wonder who did it?&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

<h3>ON PROBATION</h3>


<p>Joe did not get to chapel that morning. He
was all ready to go with Tom and the others after
making a hasty toilet, when a messenger came to
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Fillmore wants to see you in his office,
Joe,&rdquo; said the messenger&mdash;a nice lad who did
this work to help pay for his tuition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wants to see me&mdash;what for?&rdquo; demanded our
hero. &ldquo;Are you sure that&rsquo;s right, Georgie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, and a teacher&rsquo;s there with him. I&rsquo;m not
sure but I think it&rsquo;s something about the overthrown
statue. I heard them mention it as they
called me to go for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The overturned statue? I don&rsquo;t know anything
about it!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;I only just this
moment saw it&mdash;from my window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the doctor wants you, anyhow,&rdquo; repeated
the messenger lad. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; assented Joe, and he started for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the doctor&rsquo;s study with wonder in his heart and
a puzzled and rather an ominous look on his face.
His companions regarded him seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose is in the wind?&rdquo; asked
Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; remarked Teeter. &ldquo;Are <i>you</i> on,
Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nary a bit. First I knew of it was when you
fellows came and told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Joe out last night?&rdquo; asked Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, he did go into town,&rdquo; replied Tom.
&ldquo;He left a note to tell me&mdash;but that was all
straight&mdash;he had permission. It can&rsquo;t be that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll hear in chapel,&rdquo; said Teeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you is it, Matson?&rdquo; asked the doctor,
as our hero entered the study. There was a
curious note in the master&rsquo;s voice, and he glanced
narrowly at Joe. &ldquo;Come in. I am sorry to have
to summon you on such an unpleasant and important
matter, but I have no choice. As you
probably know, the Founder&rsquo;s Statue was overturned
last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked questioningly at Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just saw it from my window,&rdquo; was the
simple answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was done last night,&rdquo; went on the doctor
with a look at a teacher who acted as proctor. &ldquo;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was a disgraceful, vile piece of vandalism. The
guilty one will be severely punished. Doubtless
you are wondering why we sent for you. It was
on account of this, which was picked up by one
of the janitors in front of the statue, when he discovered
its fallen position this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Fillmore held out to Joe the telegram our
hero had received from his father the night previous!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this yours?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes, it came to me last night. It&rsquo;s from
my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do after you got it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put it in my pocket and went out to answer
it. I had permission from the proctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; assented that official. &ldquo;But I
did not see you come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I was late. The telegraph office was not
open, and I had to rouse the operator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you last see this telegram?&rdquo; asked
the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I missed it soon after I started, but I concluded
that I had dropped it,&rdquo; said Joe. Then it
all came to him. The school authorities believed
that the telegram had dropped out of his pocket
when he was at the work of overturning the
statue, in which vandalism he had no hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was picked up near where the vile work
went on,&rdquo; said the doctor bitterly. &ldquo;It is evidence
that even if you had no actual hand in the
dastardly horseplay, that you might have witnessed
it, and you can tell us who did it. That
is what we now call on you to do, Matson. Tell
us who did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; cried poor Joe. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
see anything of it. I got in a little late, and went
at once to my room. That telegram may have
dropped from my pocket at any time, someone
may have picked it up and put it&mdash;I mean dropped
it&mdash;as they were passing the statue&mdash;either before
or after it was pulled from the base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is hardly likely,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I
am very sorry, Matson, but I must conclude that
even if you had no hand in the vandalism, that you
know who did it, or suspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Joe eagerly. &ldquo;Someone
may have put this telegram there to make it
look&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped in some confusion. He never had
been a &ldquo;squealer,&rdquo; and he was not going to begin
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know what you mean,&rdquo; said the proctor
quietly. &ldquo;You mean that some enemy of
yours may have had an object in making it appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
as if you had a hand in this work.&rdquo; He looked
narrowly at Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I, well, it might have happened that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of the students here, whom would you
regard as your enemy?&rdquo; asked Dr. Fillmore
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I must refuse to answer,&rdquo; said Joe
firmly. &ldquo;It would not be fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you won&rsquo;t tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Doctor. I haven&rsquo;t any right to assume
that the telegram came there that way. I
know that I didn&rsquo;t pass very near the statue,
either on leaving or coming back to school. The
message dropped from my pocket, I&rsquo;m sure of
that, but the wind may have blown it near the
statue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no wind last night,&rdquo; said the proctor
severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do, Matson,&rdquo; said the doctor quietly,
and there was sorrow in his voice. &ldquo;I will
not question you further. I am convinced that
if you had no hand in the actual overturning of
the statue, that you know something of how it was
done, or who did it. Are you prepared to tell
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I am not. I&mdash;can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; said Dr. Fillmore.
&ldquo;Very well. Understand, we do not accuse you
of anything, but under the circumstances I must
put you on probation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probation?&rdquo; murmured Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the proctor as the doctor turned
away. &ldquo;That means that you will not be allowed
to leave the school grounds. You will report to
your classes and lectures as usual, but you will
not be allowed to take part in athletic contests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not baseball?&rdquo; gasped Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not baseball,&rdquo; replied the proctor. &ldquo;I am
sorry, but that is the rule for one who is on probation.
When you make up your mind to make a
complete confession, and tell whom you saw at
the work of tearing down the statue&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; interrupted the proctor gently.
&ldquo;You are on probation until then. And you will
not be allowed to play baseball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe felt his heart wildly thumping under his
coat. Without a word he turned aside and went
back to his room. And that is why he missed
chapel that morning.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

<h3>LUKE&rsquo;S CONFESSION</h3>


<p>The anticipation of Teeter, Peaches and the
others that there would be a sensation in chapel
that morning was borne out. Never, in all their
experience, had the boys recalled Dr. Fillmore
being more bitter in his denunciation of what he
characterized as &ldquo;sensational vandalism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He liked boys to have good, clean healthy fun,
he said, and an occasional prank was not out of
order, but this pulling the statue from its base
passed all bounds. More and more bitter the
good doctor became. Perhaps part of his feeling
was due to the fact that the Founder had written
a book on Cæsar that the head of the school considered
an authority, and you remember how fond
Dr. Fillmore was of the writer of the &ldquo;Commentaries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other as the denunciation
proceeded, and there were whispers of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did it? Why doesn&rsquo;t he name some
one?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor came to that part in a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are unable to say who perpetrated this act
of sensational vandalism,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but I
may say that once the students are discovered they
will be instantly dismissed from Excelsior Hall&mdash;this
is no place for them. I say we do not know
who did it, but we have reason to suspect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the good doctor paused and there was an
uneasy movement among several lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have reason to suspect that some one
knows who did it, but will not tell. I am sorry to
say that we have been obliged to inflict the usual
punishment on this&mdash;ahem&mdash;student and he is now
on probation. The usual exercises will now be
held.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went on, but it is doubtful if the lads
were in a very devotional spirit. Joe&rsquo;s absence was
at once noted, and of course it was guessed why
he was not there, though being on probation did
not bar one from chapel or classes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, when they were
on their way to first lectures. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Joe! Who&rsquo;d
ever dream it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why he was wanted in the office,&rdquo;
added Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he had a thing to do with
it!&rdquo; declared Teeter vehemently.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; chorused the other two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they evidently think he does,&rdquo; went on
Tom. &ldquo;Here he comes now; let&rsquo;s ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what does it all mean anyhow?&rdquo; inquired
Teeter when he had warmly clasped Joe&rsquo;s
hand.</p>

<p>The young pitcher told of the finding of the
telegram, and its result.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, hang it all, that&rsquo;s no evidence!&rdquo; burst
out Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor thinks so,&rdquo; replied Joe grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one who has a grudge against you&mdash;Say!&rdquo;
exclaimed Teeter with a sudden change of
manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it was Luke or Hiram who did
it&mdash;pulled the statue down and then tried to blame
it on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; chorused Tom and Peaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough for me
to be suspected of knowing something that I don&rsquo;t,
but we can&rsquo;t go to accusing even Hiram or Luke
on mere guesswork. It won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But hang it all, man!&rdquo; cried Peaches. &ldquo;You
<i>can&rsquo;t play ball</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Joe quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the league season is closing! How are
we going to win without you in the box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Brown or Akers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
will have to twirl&mdash;they&rsquo;re pretty good at it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were sorrowful shakes of the heads, but
so it had to be. It may well be imagined that
there was a sensation in Excelsior Hall when it
was known that Joe was the one on probation,
and he was urged by more than one to tell all he
knew, no matter on whose shoulders the guilt
would fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he insisted again and
again. &ldquo;And it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The days went on. Frank Brown was tried out
in the box and did fairly well, thanks to the efficient
coaching Joe had given him. Excelsior even
won a game with him twirling, though by a narrow
margin, and against a weak team.</p>

<p>But there were dubious shakes of the heads of
the students&mdash;especially those on the team&mdash;when
they thought of the games to come&mdash;the important
final with Morningside. Still there was no help
for it, and Brown and Akers redoubled their practice
in anticipation.</p>

<p>There was no objection to Joe practicing, or
in coaching the two substitute pitchers, and he did
this every day. Our hero did not write home
about the disgrace that had come so undeservedly
upon him, merely telling general news, and assuring
his father that he had kept a lookout, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
made inquiries, but had neither seen nor heard
anything of Mr. Holdney.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the affairs of Mr. Matson&mdash;due to
the theft of the models&mdash;were in anything but
good shape. Still nothing could be done.</p>

<p>Joe bitterly felt his position. So did his chums,
and they even tried their hand at amateur detective
work, endeavoring to discover who had pulled
down the statue and put Joe&rsquo;s telegram where it
had been found. That it was put there was certain,
for Joe, on the night in question, had not
gone near the statue. In the meanwhile the bronze
had been put back in place and repaired. Among
the students there were those who thought they
knew the guilty ones, but nothing definite was disclosed.</p>

<p>The school term was drawing to an end. After
the hard work of getting the ball team into shape
for championship honors it was hard to see it begin
to slip back. Yet this is what took place.
Brown and Akers could not keep up the pace set
by Joe, and several games were lost.</p>

<p>By hard work, and more due to errors on the
part of their opponents, Excelsior won victories
over Trinity and the preparatory school. This
made her percentage just high enough so that if
she should win from Morningside in the final game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the Blue Banner would come to her. But could
Excelsior win? That was what every lad there
asked himself.</p>

<p>It was rumored that Morningside was never in
better shape. Ted Clay, the pitcher, was twirling
in great form it was said, and Sam Morton, as
substitute, was sure to go in for several innings in
the final contest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s a wonder for a short time,&rdquo;
Peaches confided to Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; frankly admitted our hero. &ldquo;I know
his style. He can&rsquo;t last, but he&rsquo;s good for part
of a game. With him and Ted against us I&rsquo;m
afraid it&rsquo;s all up with our chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joe, if you could only play!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to as much as you want me, Peaches,
but it&rsquo;s out of the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe if we were to put it up to the doctor&mdash;that
we would lose the Blue Banner without you&mdash;he&rsquo;d
let you play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t play that way, Peaches&mdash;under a
ban. I want vindication&mdash;or nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so&mdash;only it&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last came the night before the final game
with Morningside. There was a spirit of unrest
and a sense of impending disaster abroad in Excelsior.
Every student was talking of it, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Hiram and Luke. The latter, for some days
past had not been his usual self, and his crony
could not understand it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, anyhow?&rdquo;
Hiram asked. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad we did that
chump Matson up good and brown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Luke slowly.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would mean that we&rsquo;d lose
the Blue Banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know we are going to lose it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we are. Morningside will win,
with no good pitcher to hold her down, and Joe is
a good pitcher, no matter what hand he had in
getting us out of the nine. I&rsquo;m sorry I got out
anyhow. I&rsquo;d like to be on it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sorry?&rdquo; gasped Hiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t have resigned only you made
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> made you! Say, what&rsquo;s eating you, anyhow?
You were as hot against Matson and his
crowd as I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t, and while we&rsquo;re on this subject
I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing. I&rsquo;m mighty sorry
I had a hand in that statue business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything&mdash;Sam and I yanked it
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, but I put Joe&rsquo;s telegram there&mdash;I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
responsible for him being on probation, so he
can&rsquo;t play to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are; eh?&rdquo; sneered Hiram. &ldquo;Then
you&rsquo;d better go tell the doctor that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove I will!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Luke
with a change of manner. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a decent
night&rsquo;s sleep since I did it. I am going to
tell. I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer. I want to see
Excelsior win the Blue Banner. I&rsquo;m going to
tell the doctor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Hiram fairly hissed. &ldquo;If you
squeal I&rsquo;ll make it so hot for you that you&rsquo;ll wish
you&rsquo;d never seen me&mdash;and so will Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid! Besides I&rsquo;m not going to tell
on you&mdash;only on myself. I&rsquo;ll say I put the telegram
there. The doctor can think what he likes
about who pulled down the statue. He can put me
on probation for I won&rsquo;t tell, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter,
for I don&rsquo;t play ball. But that will let Joe play,
and it&rsquo;s not too late for him to get in shape&mdash;in
fact, he&rsquo;s at top notch, for I saw him practice to-day.
I&rsquo;m going to tell, and you can do as you like,
Hiram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say you shan&rsquo;t tell. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Luke slipped from Hiram&rsquo;s room, where
the talk had been going on, and made his way to
the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Fillmore, as may well be imagined, was
surprised to see Luke at that late hour, for it was
past eleven. He laid aside a book on the immortal
Cæsar, looked over his glasses at the conscience-stricken
lad, and asked in his kind voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Fodick, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;Doctor Fillmore, I&rsquo;ve come to&mdash;confess.
I put that telegram by the statue. Joe
Matson didn&rsquo;t do it. He dropped it&mdash;I picked it
up. He had nothing to do with pulling down the
statue and doesn&rsquo;t know who did it. But he&rsquo;s got
to play ball to-morrow or we&rsquo;ll lose the Blue
Banner again. I&rsquo;m the guilty one, Doctor&mdash;not
of pulling the statue down&mdash;I won&rsquo;t tell who did
that, no matter what you do to me. But I want
Joe to play. Oh, I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer.
I haven&rsquo;t slept, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Luke burst into a fit of weeping&mdash;hot, passionate
tears of real sorrow&mdash;the best thing he
had done in many a long day&mdash;and Dr. Fillmore,
understanding a boy&rsquo;s heart as few heads of
schools do, put his big arm over Luke&rsquo;s shoulder.
Thus was the confession made, and of its effect
you shall soon hear.</p>

<p>That night Luke slept soundly.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

<h3>A GLORIOUS VICTORY</h3>


<p>It was the morning of the day of the big game&mdash;the
final contest between Morningside and
Excelsior for the possession of the Blue Banner.
So far the two nines were tied as regards their
percentage of victories, and the banner would go
to whoever won the diamond battle on this occasion.</p>

<p>Dr. Fillmore, after hearing Luke&rsquo;s confession,
had sent a messenger to Joe&rsquo;s room with instructions
to see if our hero and Tom were asleep.
The apartment was in darkness and quiet reigned
when the messenger listened, so he reported that
both lads were slumbering. But he was not altogether
right, for Joe tossed restlessly on his pillow
and thought bitterly of the morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as long as he is asleep,&rdquo; remarked the
good doctor to the coach whom he had summoned,
&ldquo;we won&rsquo;t tell him the good news until to-morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
He&rsquo;ll need his rest if he is to pitch against Morningside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re going to remove the probation
ban, Dr. Fillmore?&rdquo; asked Dr. Rudden eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I shall make the announcement at
chapel, and wish Matson and the others of the
nine all success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t yet know who pulled down the
statue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It was manly of Fodick to confess, and
though I shall have to suspend him, of course, I
didn&rsquo;t even ask him to inform on the guilty ones.
I really couldn&rsquo;t, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. But I&rsquo;m glad Joe is going
to play. I think we shall win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; murmured Dr. Fillmore.</p>

<p>The surprise and gratification of the students
may easily be surmised when the next morning at
chapel, Dr. Fillmore made his announcement, stating
that Joe had been on probation under a misapprehension,
and that now the ban was removed
he could play ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I hope that he and the others of the
nine play their very best,&rdquo; concluded the head of
the school, &ldquo;and win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a spontaneous cheer, and neither the
doctor nor any of the teachers took the trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to stop it. Joe&rsquo;s face was burning red, his heart
was thumping like a trip hammer, but he was the
happiest lad in school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s great! Glorious! I can&rsquo;t talk!
Whoop!&rdquo; yelled Teeter, once out of chapel, as he
balanced himself on his toes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, old man, it&rsquo;s too good to be true!&rdquo; cried
Peaches, yelling and capering about until his usually
fair complexion was like that of a beet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make Morningside look like thirty
cents!&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, you and Ward get in all the practice
you can,&rdquo; ordered Peaches.</p>

<p>The game was to be played on the Morningside
diamond, this having been decided by lot, the
choice having fallen to the rivals of Excelsior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll beat &rsquo;em on their own grounds!&rdquo;
declared Peaches, when he and the others of the
nine, with some substitutes, and a host of &ldquo;rooters&rdquo;
and supporters, departed for the contest.</p>

<p>What a crowd was there to see! What hosts
of pretty girls! Men and women, too; old graduates,
students from both schools, many from other
schools in the league, for this was the wind-up
of the season.</p>

<p>Out on the diamond trotted the Morningside
nine, to be greeted with a roar of cheers. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
began practice at once, and it was noticed that
Sam Morton was &ldquo;warming up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to use two pitchers all right,&rdquo;
observed Tommy Barton. &ldquo;Guess they heard
that Joe was going to be on deck again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A noisy welcome awaited the Excelsior nine as
they trotted out, and they, too, began batting and
catching practice. Then, after a little delay and
the submitting of batting orders, the details were
completed, and once again the umpire gave his
stirring call:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morningside was to bat last and so George
Bland was the first of the Excelsior players to
face Pitcher Clay. The two nines were the same
as had met a few weeks previously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire again, and the
game was on.</p>

<p>It was a memorable battle. They talk of it to
this day at Excelsior and Morningside. For three
innings neither side got a run, goose eggs going
up in regular succession until, as is generally the
case &ldquo;pitchers&rsquo; fight&rdquo; began to be heard spoken
on the stands and side lines. And truly it was
rather that way. Both Joe Matson and Ted Clay
were at their best, and man after man fanned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
air helplessly, or stood while the umpire called
strikes on them.</p>

<p>But there had to be a break, and it came in the
fourth inning. In their half of that Excelsior
again had to retire without a run, and the four
circles looked rather strange on the score board.</p>

<p>Then something happened. Joe was delivering
a puzzling drop, but his hand slipped, the curve
broke at the wrong moment and the batter hit it
for three bases. That looked like the beginning
of the end for a little while, as the Morningside
lads seemed to have struck a winning streak and
they had three runs to their credit when Joe, after
having struck two men out, caught a hot liner
himself and retired the third man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three to nothing,&rdquo; murmured Captain Ward
as his men came in to bat again. &ldquo;It looks bad&mdash;looks
bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will only give us an appetite,&rdquo; declared
Joe. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; and it did seem as if he were a
prophet, for the rivals of Morningside, evidently
on desperation bent, &ldquo;found&rdquo; Ted Clay, rapped
out five runs, putting them two ahead, and then
the crowd went wild.</p>

<p>So did Joe and his mates. They fairly danced
as they took the field again; danced and shouted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
even jumping over each other in the exuberance
of their joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em going! We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em going!&rdquo;
they yelled.</p>

<p>Glumly, and almost in a daze, the Morningside
players looked at the figures. Their rivals were
two ahead in the fifth inning and Baseball Joe, the
pitcher on whom so much depended, was &ldquo;as
fresh as a daisy,&rdquo; as Tom declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t won the game by a whole
lot!&rdquo; warned Captain Ward to his enthusiastic
lads. &ldquo;Play hard&mdash;play hard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morningside managed to get one run in their
half of the fifth, but when Excelsior came up for
her stick-work again she easily demonstrated her
superiority over the other lads. Four runs went
to her credit, and only one to the rival team, and
then, as Peaches said, &ldquo;it was all over but the
shouting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The game is in the ice box now, all right,&rdquo;
Teeter added.</p>

<p>And so it was. Two runs for Excelsior in the
seventh to one for her opponent; four in the
eighth, while Joe held the enemy hitless in their
half of that inning, brought the score to the tally
of fifteen to six in favor of our friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it an even 20 fellows!&rdquo; proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Teeter when they came to have their last raps in
the ninth. &ldquo;We can do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; his mates assured him, and it did seem
possible, for Morningside appeared to have gone
to pieces. Ted Clay was being batted all over the
field, his support was poor, while the Morningside
lads could not seem to find the ball.</p>

<p>In desperation, that last inning, Sam Morton
was sent in, and he faced Joe with a scowl on his
face. But Sam could not stem the winning tide,
and he was batted for five runs, making the even
twenty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, hold &rsquo;em down, Joe&mdash;don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em get
a run!&rdquo; urged Teeter, when Morningside prepared
to take her last chance to retrieve her falling
fortunes.</p>

<p>And Joe did. Amid a riot of cheers he struck
three men out in quick succession, and a final goose
egg went up in the last frame, the score reading:</p>

<p>Excelsior, 20; Morningside, 6.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Blue Banner is ours! The Blue Banner
comes back where it belongs!&rdquo; yelled Joe, and
then, amid a silence, the banner was taken from
in front of the Morningside stand, where it had
flaunted in the breeze, and presented to Captain
Ward Gerard, who proudly marched about the
diamond with it at the head of his victorious lads.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

<h3>GOOD NEWS&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>There were the usual cheers first by the victors
and then by the vanquished, and it would be hard
to say which were the heartiest. For Morningside
was a good loser and next to a well-beaten
rival, she loved a staunch victorious one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellows certainly did us up good and
proper&mdash;the worst beating we ever got,&rdquo; admitted
Captain Dalton to Ward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we came here for,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;It was Joe&rsquo;s twirling that did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; cried the modest pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that certainly held us down,&rdquo; went on
Dalton. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t seem to find you. I&rsquo;ll
need some new pitchers next season, I guess, for
you certainly batted Ted and Sam all over. But
I&rsquo;m not kicking. How are you fixed for next year,
Joe? Don&rsquo;t you want to come to Morningside?&rdquo;
and he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered our hero. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
haven&rsquo;t quite made up my mind what I shall do.
I&rsquo;m going to play ball, I know that much, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would&mdash;any fellow who
can twirl the horsehide as you can. Well, might
as well get off these togs,&rdquo; spoke Dalton. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t need &rsquo;em here any more this season, though
I&rsquo;m going to join some amateur team for the vacation
if I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cheering and yelling kept up for some time;
and then with the glorious Blue Banner, that
meant so much to them in their possession, the
Excelsior Hall lads started back for the school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t know what you are going to do
next season, eh, Joe?&rdquo; asked Tom, as he and his
chum were riding back. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d stick
on here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to, first rate but I don&rsquo;t know
how dad&rsquo;s business is going to be since this second
robbery. I may have to leave school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not. So they haven&rsquo;t any trace
of the missing papers and models?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not according to what I last heard. I&rsquo;m going
to get on the trail of that scamp, Holdney,
this vacation, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As might have been guessed, there was a big
banquet for the baseball team that night. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
such a spread as it was, held in the big gymnasium.
Every player came in for his share of praise, and
there was so much of it for Joe; and his health
was drunk in soda and ginger ale so often that his
complexion was like that of Peaches&rsquo;&mdash;red and
white by turns. But nearly everyone felt that he
deserved all the nice things that were said about
him, not only for his share in the victory, but for
what he had suffered.</p>

<p>There were two absentees at the banquet&mdash;and
only two. One was Hiram Shell and the other
Luke Fodick. Luke humbly told Dr. Fillmore
that he thought it best to leave the school after
what had happened. The good doctor thought
so, too, for it would have been hard for Luke to
live down what he had done.</p>

<p>As for Hiram, he said nothing, but when he
knew that Luke had made his confession, the bully,
after using harsh language to his former crony,
quietly packed his things and went also. He sent
word to Sam, at Morningside, that &ldquo;the jig&rdquo; was
up, and there was a pre-vacation vacancy on the
books of that institution.</p>

<p>It was never definitely stated who had pulled
down the statue, but the withdrawal of Hiram,
Luke and Sam was confession enough.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of the banquet, when Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
had been called upon to respond to the toast,
&ldquo;The Baseball Nine,&rdquo; that a messenger was seen
to enter with a telegram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Joe Matson,&rdquo; the boy announced
loudly enough for all to hear. &ldquo;Gee, but he&rsquo;s de
stuff; eh? I&rsquo;d like to shake hands wit a pitcher
like dat! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; be one mysel&rsquo; some day.
Here&rsquo;s de tick-tick, sport,&rdquo; and he passed the
message to Joe, at the same time regarding our
hero with worshipful eyes.</p>

<p>Joe read the message at a glance, and a change
came over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No bad news, I hope,&rdquo; murmured Tom, who
stood near him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s the very best!&rdquo; cried the young
pitcher, and he showed Tom the telegram. &ldquo;I
wired dad that we&rsquo;d won the game,&rdquo; Joe stated.</p>

<p>Mr. Matson said in his telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Best of congratulations. Models and papers
recovered. Everything all right.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; yelled Tom, waving the message
above his head. &ldquo;Three cheers for Baseball
Joe!&rdquo; and, when the cheers had subsided he
briefly informed his mates what the telegram
meant to our hero. Mr. Matson would still retain
his fortune, and probably make more money than
ever out of his patents.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! Dis is great!&rdquo; murmured the diminutive
messenger, as he listened to the cheers and
watched the jolly crowd of students. &ldquo;I wish
I was studyin&rsquo; here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe shook the messenger&rsquo;s hand and left in it
a crisp bill, to show his appreciation of the good
news the lad had brought. And the toasting, the
cheering and singing went on again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you can continue your studies,&rdquo; said
Tom to Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll even go to college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What were his further fortunes on the diamond
I shall tell you in the next book of this series, to
be called: &ldquo;Baseball Joe at Yale; or Pitching for
the College Championship.&rdquo; In that we shall see
him in adventures as strenuous as any he had yet
encountered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One last song, fellows, and then we&rsquo;ll quit!&rdquo;
called Peaches. &ldquo;I want you all to join with me
in singing: &lsquo;For He&rsquo;s a Jolly Good Fellow,&rsquo; and
by &lsquo;<i>He</i>&rsquo; I mean Joe Matson&mdash;Baseball Joe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as the strains of that ever-jolly, and yet
somewhat sad, song are dying away, we will take
our leave for a time of Baseball Joe and his
friends.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
